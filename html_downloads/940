The Center  combines technology resources with expert consultation and personnel, in  an effort to provide faculty with a "one-stop" guide to  technology-based courses. CLEAR delivers content through the use of the  University of North Texas Videoconferencing Network (UNTVN). UNTVN is a  video network connecting several videoconferencing classrooms in the  Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. CLEAR facilitates the delivery of  videoconference based courses every semester and also schedules many  non-class related videoconferences. CLEAR is based out of Chilton Hall,  located on the University of North Texas Campus, Suite 112.
