Click the Edit tab above the page's title.How to sort People by custom categoriesBy default, we provide 3 categories for People: Faculty, Staff, and Teaching Assistants. If you need additional categories or subcategories, you can add them yourself.Go to Structure » Taxonomy » People type » Add term. Enter the category you want to add in the Name field. You do not need to add a description. Save the new term. It will now appear in the drop-down options when adding or editing People.If you'd like a category to appear as a subcategory of an existing category, go to Structure » Taxonomy » People type. You will see a list of the existing terms. You can drag and rearrange the categories as you see fit. This is useful when wanting to subdivide a main category: for example, Faculty could have subcategories of Emeritus Faculty and Lecturers.These categories need to be added to your menu manually. To do so, go to Structure » Menus » Main Menu » Add Link. Enter the title that will appear in the menu. For the Path, enter in people/the-category-you-added. Replace the-category-you-added with the category you added. It will be the category name you created previously, but all lowercase and with all spaces replaced with hyphens. Additionally, common short words will be removed (examples: to, in, and, for). Some examples of category paths:Category name: Emeritus FacultyPath: people/emeritus-facultyCategory name: Biochemistry and Molecular BiologyPath: people/biochemistry-molecular-biologyCategory name: \u200bProfessorsPath: people/professors                       Contact Information  U.S. Postal Address University of North Texas College of Arts and Sciences 1155 Union Circle #305189 Denton, TX  76203-5017          Contact Us     For questions about the content on this website, contact us.
