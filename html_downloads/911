The Research and Statistical Support Services group provides support for survey research for many departments on campus.  However, before getting started it is strongly recommended you have a basic understanding of test development, reliability, validity and other concepts regarding test theory, sources for which we will be happy to provide. One good place to learn more about survey research methods is by spending some time reading through the Proceedings of the Survey Research Methods section of the American Statistical Association (all proceedings are available as Adobe PDFs): https://www.amstat.org/sections/SRMS/Proceedings/ It also is important to note that all UNT community members have access to the Qualtrics software through the my.unt.edu portal.
