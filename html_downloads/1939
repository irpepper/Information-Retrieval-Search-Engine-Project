Projects/Grants  (2012) Developed and completed the \u201cProfession Guide for Students Project.\u201d The project has been developed as a part of counter terrorism efforts in Diyarbak\u0131r. My own studies have shown that terrorist organizations recruit people also by spreading the idea that the government is willingly not providing any acceptable future to the children in the South Eastern regions in Turkey. Therefore the claims of terror organizations had to be proven wrong to stop further recruitment of young people. Hence, the children must be provided an information source that explains all the possibilities the country offers to them. In addition, the students need to be made clear that factors such as their income, their birth of region or their ethnicity are not a limiting factor for them to obtain an occupation they want in Turkey. In other words, this project also serves for the purpose of creating more bonding between an individual (students in this case) and their communities. At the initial phase, around 30 thousand profession guides (booklets) have been distributed in Diyarbak\u0131r schools. Then the project has been introduced and recommended to all other Police Directorates and Governorships in Turkey with the hope to have them launch a similar approach within their provinces. (2011) Developed and recently commenced the \u201cWorkplace and Residence Security Consultation Project\u201d in Ba\u011flar/Diyarbak\u0131r (Project also appeared on the National News) which enables the close cooperation of residents toward securing their workplaces and residences through advising them what kind of measures they can take in such locations to reduce the risk of them becoming the victim of a crime. This project reduces the number of risk locations in the area of responsibility of the police. (2010) Developed and commenced the \u201cCitizens Owned and Run- Safe Neighbourhood Camera System Project.\u201d  A pilot project that provided highly satisfying results in regard to fighting crime in Yenisehir/Diyarbak\u0131r. The project reduced the need for police patrols and additional security costs.Counter Terrorism Related Security Project. Received a grant of 35,000 Euros and organized the NATO Advanced Research Workshop titled \u201cCounter Terrorism in Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Communities\u201d held in Antalya, Turkey 8-9 May, 2011. This project aimed to provide understanding and guidance for counter terror units during their operations within diverse communities and to inform them about the possible risks such communities bear within them. Bearing in mind that almost all communities in the 21st century have become very diverse; the project\u2019s title underlines the importance of such a work. The project\u2019s presentations have been published by NATO as a NATO publication by IOS Press in the Netherlands.(2009) Organized a workshop focusing on the safety of disabled people in order to develop safety policies, Diyarbak\u0131r, Turkey.(2008) Counter Terrorism Related Security Project. Received a grant of 35,000 Euros for the NATO Advanced Research Workshop titled \u201cBuilding Terrorism Resistant Communities (BTRC)\u201d held in Washington, D.C. September 26-27, 2008. The goal of the project was to determine the path that could lead to more involvement of the community in the battle against terrorism since we are aware that terrorists also use the same communities we live in for their planning and the execution of their lethal attacks. Hence, if all members of the community can be given the awareness about terror related threats, they can inform the law enforcement agencies in advance to take counter terror measures. These efforts will also reduce the free environment for the terrorists within their communities which may make the terrorists either abandon that community or make them see the risk of high awareness against terrorism and prevent them from threatening that community. The project\u2019s presentations have been published by NATO as a NATO publication by IOS Press in the Netherlands.TIPS Connections Publication Project. Received a grant of $166,000 from the Turkish Government for to promote cooperation in security and promoting Turkey\u2019s efforts in the world in regard to international security (served as project coordinator and Editor of TIPS Connections Magazine for 2 years in the USA).(2006) Counter Terrorism Related Security Project. Received funding of 50,000 Euros from NATO, together with three other friends, to assess The Social Dimensions of Terrorism. Involved parties were the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Turkish National Police (TNP).  The project\u2019s presentations have been published by NATO as a NATO publication by IOS Press in the Netherlands.(2005) Member of organizing committee of the 1st International Istanbul Conference on Democracy and Global Security.

NOTECurrently, I am deployed to Bursa Police Directorate. I will serve as the Chief of Police of the most highly populated district in Bursa (900 thousand residents). Before this deployment I was serving as the District Chief of Police in an area (Baglar-Diyarbakir) where the PKK terrorist organization is quite active. I was actively involved in counter terror measures and I also developed several supplemental counter terror policies to support the traditional counter terror operations in my area of responsibility.  Among my academic field of interests are: terrorism studies, development of security policies which also includes the development of contemporary and/or supplemental counter terrorism methods and methods to fight other crimes in addition to diversity studies as part of public administration topics.  I have almost 18 years of experience as manager at various levels (mid and high levels) within the Turkish National Police (Civilian Police) and the United Nations Peace Keeping Operations. I am able to view problems from various angles in order to come up with new effective and efficient solutions. I also teach various PA and security related classes at vocational police higher educations or universities once I can free some time from my work. I can describe myself as a result-oriented flexible person. I am used to handling and coping with sudden developments during my work; hence, my capacity of crisis management is practical.   The projects I have developed and/or the policies I have suggested so far always consider cooperation among agencies or cooperation between citizens and agencies. These projects also focus on governance, efficiency and effectiveness in regard to the sources to be utilized. I have both the essential field experience and the philosophical education to develop solutions to problems.     I have studied, worked and lived for years abroad (USA, the Netherlands, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada) and therefore have sufficient international working and living experience. I also served during the establishment and improvement of several offices and departments (within the UN and the Turkish National Police). Such an experience enables me to foresee the possible problems in relation to establishment of new organizations and problems due to cultural changes within existing ones. My promotions and received commendations/awards during the United Nations Peace Keeping mission and during my various services within the Turkish National Police, prove my ability of problem solving and the skills demanded from a Manager Project/Coordinator to implement new policies or from a scholar who needs to develop new policies.                                              Visit Us  Chilton Hall        Room 204 410 Avenue C Denton, Texas 76201          Mail Us   University of North Texas       1155 Union Circle #311070 Denton, TX 76203       Contact Us   940-565-2165 Technical issues?
