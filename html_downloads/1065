Most fabric defects are preventable and correctable if discovered on the loom on time. \u201cDetecting weave defects is an integral part of modern weaving. While some devices are able to spot flaws, many are extremely difficult to be used on loom,\u201d said Xu, adding that most fabric inspection systems are designed for post-weaving detections and don\u2019t capture problems in real time. Instead of relying on machines, human workers are still needed for quality assurance checks during and after the weaving process. Xu aims to fix this costly problem by creating an on-loom fabric defect inspection system that uses contact image sensors to detect flaws, automatically stop the loom and alert workers to fix the cause of defects. Currently, his team is working on a prototype with the capability to rapidly capture high-resolution images as fabric passes beneath the machine and then use machine-learning algorithms to locate fabric flaws in those images. The key is, however, to make the system affordable so that it can be used on individual weaving machines. A single textile mill can own several hundred modern looms, which results in a heavy capital cost, said Xu. \u201cIt has to be a practical solution,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere are already commercial systems in the world that do something similar, but those are very complex, expensive machines, and almost price-inhibitive to many textile manufacturers.\u201d The grant, which Xu was awarded while working at the University of Texas, was among a total of $2.84 million in grants that were given to five research and academic institutions in 2016. A total of $10 million in grants will be awarded during the next five years. \u201cThrough these grants, we hope to help remove the barriers to revitalizing and growing U.S. apparel manufacturing, while creating more sustainable production processes,\u201d said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. \u201cThe U.S. Manufacturing Innovation Fund is part of Walmart and the Walmart Foundation\u2019s broader commitment to foster new economic growth and opportunity and create stronger communities.\u201d    UNT News Service Phone Number: (940) 565-2108              Contact:         (940) 369-7782            Email:        monique.bird@unt.edu                        Follow us                   Visit Us       University Service Building    2310 N.
