Choose POD locations from a list of available facilities. Allocate SNS and personnel across chosen PODs to complete dispensing within time limits. Assign an equal population to each POD location. Minimize the distance the population must travel. Examine POD facilities without leaving the office by automatically linking to Google Earth\u2019s 3D imagery. Analyze traffic resulting from plan activation. Identify vulnerable and at-risk populations to minimize access disparities including:  Lack of access to transportation. Inability to communicate in English. Special needs related to age.   Click here to download a flyer which summarizes the features of RE-PLAN. RE-PLAN was created at the Center for Computational Epidemiology and Response Analysis (CeCERA). Support for the RE-PLAN project has been provided by the National Institutes of Health (1R01LM011647-01 and 1R15LM010804-01), the National Science Foundation (NSF 1514390), the Texas Department of State Health Services, and Tarrant County, TX.
