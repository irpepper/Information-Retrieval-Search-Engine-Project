Report needs of the UNT libraries and how these relate to the UNT community as a whole. Continue to lobby for more funding for the library. Provide projections on the impact on libraries for AY 2010-2011 of the budgeting process. In cooperation with the Dean of Libraries, gather data regarding library spending at UNT on a per-student and a per-faculty basis. Gather similar data from schools in our peer groups, as well as some other universities that are members of the Association of Research Libraries (ARL). To the extent that such data are available over a number of years, collect these as well. Report comparative results to the Faculty Senate and the Dean of Libraries. At least once per semester report to the Committee on Faculty Participation in Governance regarding any issues of concern the University Library Committee might have with respect to implementation of its recommendations.                                   Contact Us:      Faculty Senate      1121 Union Circle P.O.
