This is a 114-hour post-baccalaureate four-year degree and includes:  70\u201378 semester hours of academic courses, plus 44 semester hours of clinic courses and a clinic externship in the fourth year.  In most circumstances, all academic course work is to be completed in three years. Students in their fourth year of the program will complete a clinical residency. Prior to beginning the clinical residency, all students are required to complete a directed research project or its equivalent and pass comprehensive, formative, and summative examinations. Program policies  All students must maintain a B average on all courses that receive graduate credit. Students may earn a grade of C in no more than two graduate courses. Students may repeat two courses in which they received a grade of C. They may repeat any given course only once. Students admitted to a graduate program should consider a clinical practicum an integral part of their graduate study. All speech and language pathology graduate students must enroll in SPHS 5060 /SPHS 5065  for a minimum of 6 semester credit hours. All audiology doctoral students must enroll in SPHS 6010  through SPHS 6090  for a minimum of 44 semester credit hours. Degree candidates may petition the department chair in writing for an exemption from clinical enrollment. Such a petition should be submitted prior to the registration period of the term/semester for which an exemption is sought. Students are expected to make satisfactory progress in clinical practicum throughout their program. If a student does not receive a passing grade in any term/semester, the student will not receive credit for the clinical clock hours. A student may be removed from the audiology or speech and language pathology program in this department when failure to make satisfactory progress has been documented. Unsatisfactory progress shall be defined as:   a grade of C or below in more than two courses. This includes any and every course repeated for a higher grade as well as any course listed as a prerequisite for graduate study; a grade of NP in two or more enrollments of clinical practicum, SPHS 5060 /SPHS 5065 , or a grade of C in two or more enrollments of SPHS 6010  through SPHS 6090 ; a grade of C in an academic course and a grade of NP in clinical practicum, SPHS 5060 /SPHS 5065 , or a grade of C in  SPHS 6010  through SPHS 6090 ; unsatisfactory defense of a thesis; and failure to pass the comprehensive examination after three attempts within a 12-month period.   Students may appeal any decision made upon the basis of these department policies. Such an appeal should be made in writing to the chair of the department. Appeals will be considered by the department according to the procedures set forth in the Student Guide and the Faculty Handbook of the university.            Return to: Degrees, Certificates, Teacher Certifications Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page Add to My Catalog               All catalogs © 2017 University of North Texas.
