The student must submit a digital copy of the thesis or dissertation to the Graduate Studies Office two weeks before the deadline established by the Toulouse Graduate School. This digital copy must be formatted as a single \u201c.doc\u201d or \u201c.docx\u201d file, must include the last name of the student in its title, and must be sent as an email attachment to music.grad@unt.edu. This process provides the Director of Graduate Studies and the Dean of the College of Music adequate time to read and approve the thesis. Once they have done so, the Graduate Studies Office will notify the student that s/he may submit the final document to the Toulouse Graduate School. The Graduate Studies Office cannot guarantee consideration of theses submitted less than two weeks prior to the deadline established by the Toulouse Graduate School.
