The online training modules allow participants to move at their own pace through each of three levels (introductory, intermediate, and advanced) for each proficiency. Each level of the specific proficiency must be successfully completed before advancing to the next level.  The introductory level establishes awareness of the proficiency, relies on objective assessment, and can be completed in under an hour.  The intermediate level builds a deeper understanding of the proficiency, includes some application and feedback, and can be completed in 3-5 hours.  The advanced level requires participants to demonstrate mastery of the proficiency, provides participants with feedback on a teaching activity or product, and can be completed in 8-10 hours.  Participants will receive badges for completing each module and a Certificate of Accomplishment once they have successfully completed all three levels of a proficiency.   What Is Expected Of Participants?  To be self-directed learners who are open to feedback and improvement To be invested in improving their understanding of teaching and learning To commit the time to complete the activities for each module  What Are The Dates For Participation? Participants may enroll and begin taking the introductory modules at any time after they read through a "Start Here" section. Intermediate and Advanced modules are released as participants complete the requirements for each level. What Is The Cost & How Do I Register?  There is no charge to participants. Instructors at UNT will have a self-enrollment link on the "My Institutions" tab in Blackboard.  If you do not see a TREE self-enrollment link on Blackboard and wish to enroll, please contact tree@unt.edu.
