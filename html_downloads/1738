While political economy offers compelling explanations of the macro-scale structures of social inequality, symbolic anthropology evokes the more micro-level social meanings of everyday life. Particularly, in my studies of the economic materialism of the 'house' and the social-moral-emotional attachment of the 'home', I have found an analytical anchor to integrate these approaches into a consolidated frame of analysis for investigating migration and urbanism in several geographic contexts.   The home/house distinction has provided me an entry point to multiple research projects organized into two general clusters of interest: 1. "Home and Away": In studying Nepali rural to urban migration, refugee resettlement in the United States, and undocumented migration through the Americas, I ask how meanings of 'home' are constructed and reconstructed through individual experiences and larger structures of mobility. 2. "Understanding the City through the Urban Periphery": From studies of Kathmandu's urbanizing localities to the diversifying suburbs of Dallas and Ft. Worth, I ask how changes to the urban periphery also reshape the center and the meaning of urbanism in the neoliberal age. With graduate students, I have had the pleasure of advising projects that deal with anthropological questions of a spatial nature; ranging from oral histories and gentrification politics in Dallas neighborhoods to the social politics of development in a Mexican fishing/tourist town and the social-environmental effects of mining in Minnesota's boundary waters.
