Students learn the professional skills necessary to assist people in overcoming challenges associated with abuse, poverty, homelessness, addiction, disability, illness, and discrimination. Social workers practice in a variety of areas including health care, child welfare, substance abuse treatment, aging, and criminal justice.   Program Requirements     Application to the major and pre-major coursesThe Bachelor of Social Work degree program is fully accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (1725 Duke Street, Suite 500, Alexandria, VA 22314-3457; 703-683-8080, ext. 205). Students may indicate an intention of majoring in social work at any point during the early part of their academic career by declaring a pre-social work major. They may consult with the College of Public Affairs and Community Service social work advisors regarding degree requirements at any time. However, formal acceptance into the social work major occurs only after successful completion of the designated pre-major courses, completion of a semester-by-semester course plan with the social work advisor, and submission and approval of a formal application for admission. Applications to the major are due on approximately the 30th calendar day of the term/semester in which pre-major courses are in process or are completed. Applications are accepted during the fall and spring terms/semesters only. The number of available slots is limited, so admission may be restricted. An application form and instructions are available in the department office. Students must adhere to the program's course sequencing and prerequisite schedule. The degree program culminates with a field-based practicum that consists of a required 12-credit-hour block. During the practicum, students practice social work skills in an agency placement for approximately 32\u201335 hours per week over the course of one semester, for a total of no less than 480 hours of practice.
