This is because it is a much smaller recruiting event than a major career fair. Expos such as these allow employers and students to have a more targeted approach to their job search and recruiting needs. Since the expos take place later in the semester than the Business Career Fair they serve as a great way for employers to fill positions that may still be vacant. Due to the expos taking place in the Business Leadership Building Atrium, students and faculty are able to conveniently attend before and after their class commitments.     Information Technology & Business Analytics Tuesday, April 11, 2017 10am-12pmBusiness Leadership Building Atrium     Finance, Insurance & Real Estate Tuesday, April 11, 2017 1pm-3pmBusiness Leadership Building Atrium     Logistics/Operations & Supply Chain Management Wednesday, April 12, 2017 12pm-2pmBusiness Leadership Building Atrium         Management Leadership, Business Development & Human Resources  Thursday, April 13, 2017 10am-12pmBusiness Leadership Building Atrium     Sales Thursday, April 13, 2017 1pm-3pmBusiness Leadership Building Atrium        Other Events    Etiquette Dinner Thursday, March 30, 2017 5:30pm-8pm Union Ballroom 314      Kinesiology, Health Professions, & Recreation Career Fair Wednesday, April 19, 2017 12pm-3:30pm Chestnut 120 A&B                                         Visit Us  Hurley Administration Bldg          Mail Us   University of North Texas       1155 Union Circle #305358 Denton, TX 76203-5107       Contact Us   Technical issues?
