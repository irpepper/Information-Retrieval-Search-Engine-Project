The socio-cultural, material, and technological adaptations to urban environments are mutually constitutive and form the backdrop of my work. I am an urban anthropologist and a full-time lecturer at UNT. My theoretical approaches and teaching interests include space and place, architecture and urban planning, D/development, organizational culture, material culture, gender and tourism. I combine anthropological investigation and pedagogy by designing projects for clients which also serve to train our students in applied research, and I approach both research and teaching with ethnographic flexibility to best understand the intimate spaces of daily life and the institutions and infrastructures that bind them together. My doctoral research investigated the contestation of cultural heritage surrounding architectural conservation and new commercial construction in the rugged Himalayan tourist destination of Leh, Ladakh - India. Back home, my recent projects in urban ecology examine residential perceptions of the water-energy nexus, and are informed by a four-field approach to the human experience.
