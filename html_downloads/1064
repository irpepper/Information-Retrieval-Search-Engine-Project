Students taking the Digital Retailing Strategies course are creating budget-friendly plans to help with online search results, website and mobile presence, digital communications to customers and consumers\u2019 online experience. Each semester, course lecturer Linda Mihalick selects a local business for the class to help, tasking students with analyzing all digital aspects through the eyes of the target consumer. \u201cA lot of people struggle with how they can express their brand online without it being just another ad,\u201d said junior Taylar Gomez, a digital retailing and merchandising double major. \u201cWe looked at her competitors, target market, SEO and social media to find small things she could do right away without hiring outside help.\u201d The store\u2019s new owner, Amanda Lucas, and her husband Luke, bought the franchise less than a year ago with a goal of turning a love of sweet treats into a profitable business. \u201cI jokingly told my husband we should buy one because we give them so much business,\u201d said Lucas, a UNT alumna. The joke turned into reality after the previous owner sold the shop. But owning a franchise doesn\u2019t guarantee success. \u201cIt was so much harder than I ever thought,\u201d said Lucas. The Lucases remodeled and added new, non-cookie items like coffee, ice cream and breakfast. Still, there are obstacles \u2013 especially with the digitally connected consumer. \u201cIt is no longer optional for businesses that want to succeed to ignore their online user experience,\u201d Mihalick said. \u201cThis class project engages students to act as consultants to a real, operating business and provide simple digital strategies that can produce huge revenue benefits.\u201d That\u2019s where the UNT students come in. Teams are identifying ways to improve the café\u2019s retail results. They\u2019re also taking on other challenges, like how to inform past customers that the store has reopened, how to attract new consumers that may not know Nestlé® Toll House® Café even exist, and how to create a café community for customers to relax, study or hang out. Merchandising junior Michael Impiccini said it\u2019s about building brand awareness and \u201cexpanding on the touch points she already has.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re selling an experience, not just a cookie. If you can get your consumers to do the work for you, they\u2019re your best advocates,\u201d said Impiccini. The top four teams presented their proposals in April to Lucas, who\u2019ll have the final say on what to implement. \u201cThis is a blessing because, not to sound cheap, this is free to my business and my family,\u201d said Lucas. \u201cEven though I\u2019m young, I\u2019m stuck in the Facebook age, so I\u2019m really excited to have people who understand digital.\u201d    UNT News Service Phone Number: (940) 565-2108              Contact:         (940) 369-7782            Email:        monique.bird@unt.edu                        Follow us                   Visit Us       University Service Building    2310 N.
