V   How to Proceed on This Website                                SEARCHING FOR EXTERNAL, NATIONALLY COMPETITIVE SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS   From: James Duban, Director Office for Nationally Competitive Scholarships  Dear UNT Students (Undergraduate and Graduate): Many nationally competitive scholarships can help fund your educations and bring added distinction to you, your résumés, and UNT. Thanks to the Internet and to the sharing of websites, highly advanced search engines are at your disposal. Still, finding an opportunity is just the beginning.  The UNT Office for Nationally Competitive Scholarships stands ready to work with you and your faculty mentors by offering feedback on style, tone, and organization on any essay you plan to submit for competition. You will enhance your writing skills and arrive at a better sense of your future plans and commitments. Moreover, undergraduates will find that they can adapt national-scholarship narratives to graduate-school admissions essays, with better chances of garnering internal fellowship support. Graduate students, in turn, end up transforming their scholarship proposals into the theoretical introductions to their master's theses or doctoral dissertations.  Stated otherwise, the process of applying for a nationally competitive scholarship is a "no lose" scenario, relative to the writing you will undertake and refine.  Here's how to proceed in a way that will let you know what's "out there," and how my office can assist you in this process. You can start by visiting the home page of the National Association of Fellowships Advisors http://www.nafadvisors.org/scholarships.htm to see some of the higher-profile opportunities.  There are, however, many more external scholarships and fellowships than these, and here's a quick way of accessing those through multiple Internet sites.  (While you are at liberty to visit these sites, including those of other universities, kindly address any questions you have about these awards to me, at jduban@unt.edu. Other universities must attend to their own students.) This search may well take several days; don't let that deter you. In days before the Internet, the search would have taken several months or years.  Visit my home page (http://www.opgf.unt.edu) for an overview of high-profile scholarships.  Graduate students should start with https://www.grad.illinois.edu/fellowship/. Both graduate students and undergraduates should then consult https://spin.infoedglobal.com/Home/GridResults. The following website (U. Maryland) allows you to search by multiple categories, with hypertext links to the scholarship sponsors: http://www.scholarships.umd.edu/minoritiesgradus.html. Regardless of what is on the right side of the screen, click on the categories to the left, and then click on the optimal sub-category. Study those opportunities, scholarship-by-scholarship, before moving on to any of the sites below.  If you try to do too much at once, the search will appear overwhelming./li>   Then visit http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/fellowships:          a. Search by field of study, etc., clicking on the hypertext of each fellowship      b. Click on each hypertext to view a description of the award, the amount of award, and deadlines.     c. Copy the title of the award      d. Paste the title into a Google that title to obtain application forms or upload instructions.    e. If applicable, also search, in the category box, for scholarships for "International Students,"    "Scholarships for Women" --or "Scholarships for Minorities."  For more scholarships for women and minorities, please check: http://scholarships.fatomei.com/scholarships-for-minorities.html       http://www.awis.org/ (awards for women in science)      http://staff.lib.msu.edu/harris23/grants/3specpop.htm       An additional resource for International Students is the following: http://www.grinnell.edu/files/downloads/Scholarships%20for%20International%20Students%202011.pdf.  http://www.grinnell.edu/offices/socialcommitment/awards/internationalstudentopps       https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/scholarships/graduate/overs-master/index   https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/scholarships/graduate/overs-res/index   Visit, as well, the following links, where you can search for opportunities under multiple categories:   Kansas State http://www.k-state.edu/artsci/scholarship          U. Arkansas http://fellowships.uark.edu/634.php      Yale University: http://www.yale.edu/yalecollege/academics/fellowships/start/other/index.html     Vanderbilt    http://ohs.vanderbilt.edu/          U.

Note, as well (on my web page www.opgf.unt.edu), the link "UNT Scholarships and Financial Aid Resources."  It will lead you to numerous hard-copy and many more Internet library resources that will prove helpful in searching for scholarships.

Also, to the future, if he decides to enroll in a grad program, the NSF has their East Asian and Pacific Summer Institutes, through which he can apply to go to Japan for engineering study and research.   For international research fellowships:  http://grad.msu.edu/fellowships/docs/internationalresearchfellowship.pdf     https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/scholarships/graduate/overs-master/index  https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/scholarships/graduate/overs-res/index   For students interested in public policy (Google the following):      Truman Scholarship            Pickering Undergraduate Foreign Affairs Fellowship          Pickering Graduate Foreign Affairs Fellowship          Rangel International Affairs Summer Enrichment Program          Rangel International Affairs Fellowship Program          Payne International Development Fellowship          The Autry Fellowship Coro Fellows Program in Public Affairs          Emerson National Hunger Fellowship          Humanity in Action Internship          Institute on Philanthropy & Voluntary Service          Scoville Jr. Peace Fellowship    For students who have excelled in sports and now intend to attend graduate school: http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/NCAA/Resources/Latest+News/2012/May/NCAA+recognizes+winter+postgraduate+scholars    Data preservation for medieval studies: http://www.clir.org/fellowships/postdoc/applicants/dc-medieval    For PForaid Summer Internships/Fellowships in the STEM disciplines (cut and paste the following into your internet search): http://www.pathwaystoscience.org/programs.asp?u=&r;=&s;=&sa;=either&p;=either&c;=either&f;=&dd;=SummerResearch_Summer Research Opportunity&ft;=&submit;=y&dhub;=SummerResearch_Summer Research Opportunity   For other internet possibilities:  http://see.orau.org/  (click on the "Undergrad Students" box; choose "internship" and "summer term" from drop-down boxes).      http://sist.fnal.gov/      http://www.sandia.gov/careers/students_postdocs/internships/index.html        If you access UNT sites off campus, you will need to use your EUID. If you have any problems with this procedure, please contact Ms. Jo Monahan at the Willis Library Reserve Desk.     ONCE YOU HAVE AN APPLICATION FORM IN HAND:  Determine the word or "character" limit for each entry;     Fill out that response in a Word document, adhering to the word or "character" limit; Place that response beneath a cut-and-paste of the essay prompt (that is, the instructions for that essay), and run that response by your faculty mentor for thematic and stylistic feedback; Incorporate that feedback into your Word document; Cut and paste that revised Word document into an email to jduban@unt.edu.  I will provide additional feedback in the areas of style and tone. When you, your mentor, and I are satisfied with that Word document, you will undertake the same process for each subsequent entry or essay. After completing each entry this way, you will cut and paste those entries into the appropriate boxes or columns of the formal application. I advise you never to work on the Internet site until you have completed the essay(s) in Word. Students should complete the application at least three weeks prior to the deadline and show a copy of the completed application to any person from whom they expect a letter of recommendation.  The completed application will give recommenders more to say about you and will also allow them to place their recommendations in the context of the specific scholarship and its expectations.  Professors will also interpret the three-week buffer as a welcome gesture of courtesy.  I look forward to working with you on these opportunities.  As publicized in my prior Eagle Connect messages, several scholarships require UNT endorsement. To compete for those opportunities, UNT students must complete the application in hard copy and secure hard-copy letters of recommendation before uploading anything online.  Students who bypass the hard-copy submission deadlines (for the seven scholarships below) will forego UNT nomination.  If you plan to complete for any of the following scholarships, you must, by the specified campus-level deadline (below), deliver all application materials to me, in hard copy. Please arrange an appointment by emailing jduban@unt.edu. Please do not begin working on these applications unless we have met in advance to discuss your eligibility (nearly all require 3.8-4.0 GPA, along with extensive records of research and leadership): ENDORSEMENT SCHOLARSHIPS AND UNT CAMPUS DEADLINES (REGARDLESS OF NATIONAL DEADLINES): Rhodes, Marshall, and Mitchell Scholarships:  August 6 (http://www.rhodesscholar.org/; http://www.marshallscholarship.org/; http://www.us-irelandalliance.org/content/3/en/George%20Mitchell%20Scholarship%20Program%20%7C%20US-Ireland%20Alliance.html Goldwater Scholarship: October 6 (http://www.act.org/goldwater/) Truman Scholarship: Nov. 15 (http://www.truman.gov) Morris K.
