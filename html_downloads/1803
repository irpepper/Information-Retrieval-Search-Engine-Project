Each applicant must first apply to and meet the general admission requirements of the Toulouse Graduate School at UNT. Then, applications for students who meet initial admission standards are forwarded to the Early Childhood Studies Admissions Committee for review and final decision. Final acceptance into the master's program is contingent upon the following:  GRE or GMAT scores submitted to the Toulouse Graduate School. Standardized test results will be considered in combination with other indicators and need not exclude a candidate who otherwise demonstrates strengths that would facilitate master\u2019s study. Three satisfactory letters of reference from professionals who address the applicant\u2019s ability to successfully pursue graduate study. An application letter explaining the purpose for undertaking graduate study at UNT, including professional plans or career goals and a discussion of professional interests.
