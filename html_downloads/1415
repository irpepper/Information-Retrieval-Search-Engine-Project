All of the classes are designed to increase your fitness level while maintaining a safe and fun "at your own pace" environment, and are often facilitated by one of our many certified instructors and trainers. These activities are a great way to meet new friends, stay in shape, and keep a regular exercise routine. Taking classes (group exercise or specialty fitness programs) is also a great way to take your workout to the next level, or break the rut of your workout routine.  Free group exercise classes are available to all currently enrolled UNT students and to all Rec Center members. Free classes are indicated on the Group Exercise Schedule with an asterisk (*). All other classes are available with the purchase of a group exercise pass. For all specialty fitness programs, please register in the Rec Sports office Monday through Friday, 8am-5pm. For more information, please call 940-565-2275 or 940-369-8347.
