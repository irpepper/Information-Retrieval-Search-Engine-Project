Faculty members are responsible for establishing standards of academic performance and for evaluating student performance in an equitable manner.  Faculty decisions in such matters are considered authoritative and can be overturned only when it has been determined that a grade was assigned in an inequitable, arbitrary, or erroneous manner. This policy outlines the grounds for a student grade appeal and the process by which it must be carried out.
