The family photos and teaching certificates of former North Texas president James Carl Matthews hanging in Laney\u2019s office show that love for education and UNT long has been a family affair.   More UNT family memories   Watch videos about the musical Wood family and read their story View more photos from the families Matthews family honored with inaugural award   And other families\u2019 pride runs just as deep. More than 25 family members of Leah Woodruff Hatfield (\u201977) attended the university through four generations. The scrapbooks chronicling her parents\u2019 courtship at the university have helped her understand why. Family patriarch and businessman Cecil \u201cZeke\u201d Martin (\u201951, \u201951 M.Ed.) always credited the university for his success, even naming his business ventures Mean Green Grocery and Martin Eagle Oil Co. His sons and several grandchildren run the family business and carry on the family tradition of green pride. The eldest of four children of Nigerian immigrants, Cynthia Uduebor (\u201900) paved the way for her younger brothers to join UNT. The university not only helped her achieve a childhood dream of becoming an attorney, but also propelled her three brothers forward and helped their family through loss. UNT\u2019s journey from a teachers training college to a major research university has been a 119-year evolution that belongs to thousands. Intertwined with the history of its alumni, the university\u2019s legacy encompasses their personal milestones. College years are filled with self discovery as students build friendships, fall in love and pursue dreams. And as alumni continue their lives and grow families, the university often remains home \u2014 part of a heritage steeped with tradition and powerful legacies that reach across generations and span accomplishment and heartbreak. \u201cAs I\u2019ve grown older, I\u2019ve realized how important my family history is and how North Texas has played such a big part,\u201d Leah says. \u201cFor many of us and our family members, North Texas is a way of life.\u201d   Links in the chain In 1920, J.C. Matthews (\u201925) left his family\u2019s peanut farm in Thalia, yearning to pursue a teaching degree. With the welcome handshake from then-university president W.H. Bruce at the train depot, Matthews\u2019 life at North Texas had begun. After graduation, he married classmate Rena Mae Waggoner (\u201925) and spent nearly 60 years \u2014 as a student, teacher, administrator, father and grandfather \u2014 creating educational opportunities at North Texas. During Matthews\u2019 senior year, the 1925 Yucca senior class page dedication fortuitously read: \u201c\u2026 We are a distinct link in the chain, and we shall never break faith with our Alma Mater. We look with admiration on the classes which have preceded us, and anticipate achievements of glory for those which shall follow us.\u201d The university embraced Matthews, shaping his career and family. He was director of the Demonstration School, North Texas\u2019 first dean of education and later vice president. In 1952, Matthews was named the university\u2019s eighth president and served 16 years. His legacy includes implementing the first doctoral education program in 1951, overseeing racial desegregation in the 1950s and sustaining a passion for education in three more generations \u2014 three children, 10 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren, as well as numerous other extended family members. His sons, Lester (\u201948) and Kenneth (\u201965), and daughter, Maydell (\u201952), called North Texas home. \u201cThe campus was my playground,\u201d says Kenneth, who explored the children\u2019s section of Voertman\u2019s Bookstore and rode his bike to listen to practicing music students. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I had until I left.\u201d As students at the Demonstration School and the college, Matthews\u2019 children were products of their father\u2019s commitment to education and started their own families at North Texas. Lester and Maydell each met their spouses \u2014 Betty Sharp (\u201950) and Sam Laney (\u201951 M.B.A.), descendants of other North Texas families \u2014 on campus. A 1953 June wedding reception for Maydell and Sam in Marquis Hall began a long tradition of family reunions and holiday celebrations on campus, mostly in the old President\u2019s House. Jim Laney, Sam and Maydell\u2019s son, says he and Mark, his twin brother, roamed their grandparents\u2019 home and the campus during visits \u2014 going to ball games with \u201cPapa,\u201d who always wore a three-piece suit and smelled of peppermints, and playing in \u201cMamo\u2019s\u201d gardens.    \u201cWe cut our teeth at the President\u2019s House,\u201d he says. Mark Laney (\u201980), a pediatric neurologist serving as president and CEO of Heartland Health in St. Joseph, Mo., modeled his career after that of his Uncle Kenneth, a pediatrician in College Station who serves on the board of the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cI used to follow him around, reading his science books when he was in college,\u201d Mark says, adding that the university and President Matthews were integral to their lives growing up. \u201cMy grandfather was a very wise and thoughtful man, telling wonderful stories that illustrated learning points.\u201d Yet, teaching wasn\u2019t just the domain of President Matthews. After following her father and earning her education degree, Maydell taught first grade in Denton for more than 35 years. \u201cMy mother could have taught any student to read,\u201d Jim says. \u201cI knew from a young age that I, too, wanted to be a teacher and that I wanted to teach at the college level.\u201d In addition to educators Maydell and Jim, Lester\u2019s daughter, Janet Wyrick (\u201975, '79 M.Ed.), is a principal in Killeen. And Kenneth\u2019s son and daughter-in-law live and teach in Denton. Will Matthews (\u201999 M.Ed.) and Amy Foraker Matthews (\u201907 M.Ed.) studied for their graduate degrees in Matthews Hall, named for Will\u2019s grandfather.    Roots run deep While the Matthews family may be one of a few North Texas families who literally grew up on campus, they are not alone in having deep university roots. After Natalie Hammack Woodruff (\u201951) passed away two years ago, Leah retrieved boxes of her mother\u2019s mementos and scrapbooks packed with faded green pennants, Homecoming programs, letters and photos. \u201cI knew I had to find my mother\u2019s wedding gown and my parents\u2019 class rings,\u201d Leah says, holding the gold North Texas rings together tight in her hand. For Leah, North Texas memories are intertwined with her family history, and spending time on campus keeps her close to them. A UNT Alumni Association board member, she volunteers at commencements because she loves listening to graduates\u2019 stories and sharing her own. \u201cWith the pride our family has for North Texas, it\u2019s just something I\u2019m supposed to do,\u201d she says. Natalie, a member of the Green Jackets, Meritum and Mary Arden Club and a class officer for two years, wrote weekly letters to her parents on school stationery. She detailed her college life, including her first date with Jack \u201cAce\u201d Woodruff (\u201951), a member of the Geezles. A later letter home would announce their engagement. Leah\u2019s great aunt, Grace Woodruff Cartwright (\u201929), was the first female member of the university\u2019s board of regents and a UNT Distinguished Alumna. Cartwright, who died in 2003, was initiated into the Texas Women\u2019s Hall of Fame for Horticulture in 1985. \u201cGrace was the matriarch of the family and a strong role model,\u201d Leah says. \u201cShe was a forward-looking woman.\u201d Cartwright was one of 10 children \u2014 four who attended North Texas in the 1920s. As chair of buildings and grounds at North Texas, she placed hundreds of trees around Fouts Field, transplanted from her ranch in Parker County, and brought stones to create a rock garden between Willis Library and the Music Building. The adjacent Grace Cartwright Library Plaza serves as a gathering place for student picnics, fairs, concerts and an occasional wedding engagement. Collecting memorabilia for her Mean Green room in her Dallas home, Leah keeps school spirit alive for her family. She\u2019s attended nearly every football game since 1987, raising her son, Bryan Ross Hatfield (\u201907), on Mean Green football since he was 4. Bryan, a Talons member like his dad Scott Hatfield (\u201977), lived in Kerr Hall, just as his mother did. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that so many of my family members found their home at UNT,\u201d Bryan says. \u201cIt gives me a great sense of pride that I\u2019m walking in their footsteps.\u201d    Love of an eagle Like Grace Cartwright, Cecil \u201cZeke\u201d Martin left behind a love for all things green that still flows through his family. One of seven brothers growing up in Denton, five who attended North Texas, Martin played basketball, tennis and football, receiving all-conference honors as a quarterback three seasons in a row and playing in the 1948 Salad Bowl. In 1989, he was inducted into the UNT Athletic Hall of Fame. Before his passing in 2006, he was an active member of the UNT Lettermen\u2019s Association and founded the Zeke Martin Letterman Golf Classic, a UNT scholarship fundraising effort. But his dedication to UNT surpassed sports. \u201cEverything was North Texas. He loved UNT,\u201d says his son, Gary Martin, who attended North Texas in the 1970s along with his brother, Steve. \u201cHe would say if North Texas hadn\u2019t given him a scholarship, he wouldn\u2019t have amounted to anything.\u201d After marrying college sweetheart Bettye Lassiter Martin (\u201949) in 1950, Zeke played professionally for the Canadian Football League\u2019s Hamilton Tigers before returning home to coach at Denton High School. He eventually served as Denton mayor in the late 1960s and helped get Interstate 35 expanded west to Fort Worth. Married for 57 years, Bettye and Zeke built their home on Bonnie Brae Street, yards from today\u2019s newest athletic facilities. \u201cZeke was so proud of how the sports facilities have grown,\u201d says Bettye, who still plays weekly bridge games in her home with friends she met at North Texas more than 50 years ago. \u201cNorth Texas was so good to us.\u201d Zeke opened his first gas station on the corner of Highland Street and Avenue C. At the same location, he ran Mean Green Grocery and Zeke\u2019s Drive-in, a hamburger shack catering to students in the 1960s. Martin Eagle Oil Co. still is soaring 50 years later under the direction of his sons and grandchildren. Following in Zeke\u2019s footsteps, both Gary and Steve grew up cheering at Mean Green games and played intramural athletics during college. Kris Martin, Gary\u2019s son and Zeke\u2019s oldest grandson, works in commercial sales at Eagle Oil and met his recent bride, Mandy Rainbolt Martin (\u201908), at UNT. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to follow what my grandfather, dad and uncle have done,\u201d he says. Zeke\u2019s office is still intact, filled with his treasures: photos of his family, trophies and newspaper clippings detailing sports highlights, community volunteer awards and more than 35 eagle statues. \u201cNorth Texas made him,\u201d Steve says.    Leading by example After immigrating to New York from Nigeria, Cynthia Uduebor\u2019s family moved frequently but eventually found their way to the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Cynthia attended six elementary schools and three high schools but graduated early at 16 and transferred to UNT from a community college a year later. A resident assistant and one of the first UNT Eagle Ambassadors, she helped plan the first Diversity Day on campus. \u201cUNT is where I discovered myself. I blossomed here,\u201d says Cynthia, who continued on to Duke Law School to become a labor and employment law attorney. \u201cUNT is so diverse, not just ethnically, but religiously and culturally. There are so many ways you can be involved. You can really do things here.\u201d Like their older sister, Otis (\u201906) and Valentine (\u201908) seized opportunities at UNT to become resident assistants and student leaders. Otis was crowned Homecoming King in 2005. Suffering from sickle cell disease since childhood, Otis beat the odds of surviving past 5 years old. Through his activities at UNT, he gave speeches to create awareness about the disease and planned to create a national campaign for education and research after his 2006 graduation. But a year after receiving his diploma, he died from the illness. Today, all of the Uduebors are the caretakers of the Otis Uduebor Sickle Cell Foundation, their brother\u2019s dream organization, with Cynthia serving as president. \u201cOtis was making a difference for sickle cell, and now he\u2019s passed the torch on to me,\u201d says Cynthia, who scaled back her law practice and volunteer work \u2014 except her role on the UNT Alumni Association board \u2014 to run the foundation. \u201cThe commitment to the association is important. I have the opportunity to help shape alumni, the future and our legacy of UNT.\u201d And the Uduebor tradition at UNT lives on. Lovett, the youngest sibling, created the first student organization for sickle cell as a freshman last year.    The spirit lives on Keeping family ties alive at UNT is important to all of the families as they preserve the tradition of what the university means to them. An education scholarship named for Rena Mae and J.C. Matthews set a Matthews family precedent. Lester and Betty became members of the President\u2019s Council giving society, and Sam established a scholarship in his wife\u2019s name after she died in 2005. \u201cI knew how Maydell felt about this scholarship,\u201d he says. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have pleased her more.\u201d The Matthews twins continue to develop opportunities for learning for UNT students. Mark helped build clinical rotations for third- and fourth-year UNT Health Science Center medical students at Cook Children\u2019s Medical Center. And Jim now serves as assistant chair for initial certification in the Department of Teacher Education and Administration. Pride continues to run deep in the Woodruff family. As a Mean Green season ticket holder, Leah shares her parents\u2019 school spirit and is carrying on her Aunt Grace\u2019s commitment to providing top-rate facilities for UNT by serving on the alumni association\u2019s ad hoc stadium committee. \u201cGrace was involved when Fouts Field was built in 1952, and now I\u2019m helping too,\u201d says Leah, adding that her aunt also endowed several academic scholarships. From one generation to the next, UNT families are growing tradition-rich lineages with each new family member adding to the North Texas legacy. Their ties are the strength of UNT\u2019s history and the promise of the brightest future. \u201cUNT has so much to offer,\u201d Valentine Uduebor says. \u201cWhen I have kids, UNT is definitely someplace I\u2019ll want them to attend.\u201d As Leah mingles with new alumni at commencement, she encourages them to venture out into the world and create remarkable lives. She also urges them always to remember their alma mater. \u201cSomewhere down the road in your life, this place will whisper to you,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you need to listen.\u201d  Legacy Families Feature Stories   3 comments       J.C. Matthews      As the youngest niece in the 1953 photo (that's all of us!) taken at the time of Sam and Maydell's wedding, I probably have fewer memories of Uncle Carl than the others.  As mentioned in the article~ I never saw him without his three-piece suit, I knew he was 'important' and visits to his home, which just happened to be the White House, were always filled with good food, and lots of love and laughter. Though not all of them are North Texas grads, the extended Matthews family is full of teachers and educators.  You either are one, are married to one or birthed one or more!  I'm proud of the legacy of education that started in the humble beginnings of that Thalia farm.

Thank you so much for pointing out the incorrect date and event on the Matthew's family photo.  We have corrected the information.  Thank you for sharing your own experiences of attending UNT as a Matthew's legacy family member.   Randena Hulstrand ('88, 'M.J.)

Matthews' niece and spent much time at the old and new President's homes.  I even attended Dr. Matthews' inauguration.  My parents (Dr. Matthews' sister) were both graduates of North Texas, and I received my BBA in 1964 and my MBA in 1966.  I met my husband, Donald Edward Francisco, at North Texas where he also received a BA and MA in the same years.  We came to UNC-Chapel Hill in 1966, and Don received his PhD in 1970.  He spent more than 30 years on the faculty at UNC, and Uncle Carl was very proud to have another professor in the family. There is one error in your story.  The picture of our family reunion was actually taken in June 1953.  We were all gathered for the wedding of Maydell Matthews and Sam Laney.   While I was an undergraduate, I tried very hard to conceal my relationship to the President of the university.  I wanted to "do it on my own."  I remember the day I was inducted into Meritum (later Mortar Board) Uncle Carl asked if it would be all right for him to claim me, and I said it would.  He was a wonderful uncle, friend, mentor and role model.  Aunt Rena was also very, very special to me.
