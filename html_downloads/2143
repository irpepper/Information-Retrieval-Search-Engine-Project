This guide is primarily intended to provide direct links to the articles and websites for the section on Critical Review of Literature in the workshops.  Part of the reason it is done this way is to comply with copyright laws, and to gather all the readings together in one place.  If any of the links do not work for you, please e-mail me and let me know there is a problem so I can fix it, or refer you to another source for the best help.
