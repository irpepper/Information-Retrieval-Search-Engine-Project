The mechanical engineering technology major is built upon a strong foundation of science, mathematics and technical course work designed to meet the diverse needs of the mechanical engineer. Mechanical engineering technology concepts are used in all types of industry and are applied directly to product and tool design and to assist in the manufacturing process. Courses in computer-aided design, product design and development, manufacturing processes and materials, fluid and thermal sciences and quality assurance provide the student with a broad range of applications for the pursuit of a career in mechanical engineering technology. Mechanical engineering technology is accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET (abet.org), (111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202; 410-347-7700). Degree requirements     Hours required and general/college requirementsA minimum of 124 semester hours, of which 42 must be advanced, and fulfillment of degree requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree as specified in the \u201cUniversity Core Curriculum \u201d in the Academics section of this catalog and the College of Engineering  requirements.Major requirements, 72 hours72 hours, chosen with the advice of an academic advisor within the department.MEET 3650 - Design of Mechanical ComponentsMEET 3940 - Fluid Mechanics ApplicationsMEET 3990 - Applied ThermodynamicsMEET 4050 - Mechanical DesignMEET 4350 - Heat Transfer ApplicationsMEET 4360 - Experimental Thermal SciencesMEET 4780 - Senior Design IMEET 4790 - Senior Design IIENGR 1304 - Engineering Graphics *ENGR 2301 - Statics *ENGR 2302 - DynamicsENGR 2332 - Mechanics of MaterialsENGR 2405 - Circuit AnalysisENGR 2415 - Circuit Analysis Lab ENGR 3450 - Engineering Materials andENGR 3451 - Engineering Materials Lab MFET 3110 - Machining Principles and ProcessesMFET 4190 - Quality AssuranceMFET 4200 - Engineering Cost AnalysisMFET 4210 - CAD/CAM System OperationsELET 3980 - Digital Control of Industrial ProcessesCSCE 1020 - Program Development3 hours of technical electives8 hours of advanced technical electivesOther course requirementsStudents registering for fall or spring term/semesters must register for mathematics until the requirement has been satisfied, unless approved by the department chair.
