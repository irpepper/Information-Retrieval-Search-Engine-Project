Through careful selection of engineering electives and electives taken toward one of the five optional tracks (see below), it may be possible for a student to fulfill the requirements for a minor in computer science and computer engineering, material science and engineering, electrical engineering, or mechanical and energy engineering. Electives, 15 hours15 hours to fulfill one of five tracks:  Biomedical instrumentation: 15 hours in BMEN or EENG courses Biomechanics: 15 hours in BMEN or MEEN courses Bioinformatics: 15 hours in BMEN or CSCE courses Biotechnology: 15 hours in BIOC/BIOL Biomaterials: 15 hours in materials science and engineering  Other requirements BMEN foundation courses include BMEN 1300 , BMEN 2210 , BMEN 2320 , MATH 1710  and TECM 2700 . Satisfactory completion of the BMEN foundation courses with a minimum GPA of 2.5 is prerequisite to taking advanced courses in the major. Mandatory advisement is required each semester until the foundation courses have been successfully completed. A major grade point average of 2.0 is required for the BS with a major in biomedical engineering.       Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page Add to My Catalog               All catalogs © 2017 University of North Texas.
