We offer you research opportunities using the latest technology inside and outside the classroom.  The electrical engineering technology major is designed to develop the technical and personal knowledge and skill necessary to compete successfully in today's electrical industries. The program builds on a strong foundation in mathematics and science and includes courses in network analysis, linear electronics, digital electronics, communication systems and control systems. Computer utilization is an integral part of all electrical courses and most courses include a laboratory to provide the necessary hands-on experience for an applied program of study. The student's technical background is further enhanced by taking selected courses from other engineering technology majors. The development of technical communication and presentation skills is a requirement throughout the curriculum. Electrical engineering technology is accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET (abet.org), (111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202; 410-347-7700). Degree requirements The following requirements must be satisfied for a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology with a major in electrical engineering technology.     Hours required and general/college requirementsA minimum of 120 semester hours, of which 36 must be advanced, and fulfillment of degree requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree as specified in the "University Core Curriculum " in the Academics section of this catalog and the College of Engineering  requirements.
