The construction engineering technology major provides educational experiences for the development of technical knowledge and skills necessary in today's construction industry. The program provides education in both the management and technical aspects, thus providing optimum opportunities for employment. The program builds on a strong foundation in mathematics, science, engineering and general education. Knowledge and skills relative to the construction field such as surveying, cost estimating, construction materials, computer design, contracts and management, safety, and structures are acquired. Technical and management skills are enhanced through courses offered by other engineering technology programs and the College of Business. The development of technical communication and presentation skills is a requirement throughout the curriculum. Construction engineering technology is accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET (abet.org), (111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202; 410-347-7700). Degree requirements The following requirements must be satisfied for a Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology with a major in construction engineering technology.
