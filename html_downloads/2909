The minimum doctoral residence requirement for performance students   consists of two consecutive long terms/semesters (fall and the following   spring, or spring and the following fall) with a minimum load of 9   hours each term/semester. The minimum residency requirement for   conducting students is four consecutive long terms/semesters with a   minimum load of 9 hours each term/semester. Conducting students in wind   studies may satisfy the residency requirements by enrolling in two   summer sessions, two long terms/semesters and two more summer sessions,   taken consecutively.

These   examinations are evaluated by the professors submitting questions, as   well as others who may be designated by the major advisor. The   qualifying examinations measure a broad knowledge of musical study. They   are designed to establish the student's ability to engage both in   scholarly research and in professional work in the major area supported   by a complete musical comprehension and a broad perspective. The student may take the qualifying examinations when the following   conditions have been met: (a) all deficiencies have been removed, (b) 30   hours of course work beyond the master's degree have been completed,   (c) at least two degree recitals have been completed (performance majors   only), and (d) an approved degree plan has been filed with the Toulouse   Graduate School. Performance majors Following successful completion of the written qualifying  examinations, the student is required to pass a two-hour oral examination that includes questioning on the  research project and on all other areas appropriate to the degree. The  student's Examination Committee (the Advisory Committee) administers this oral examination. When both parts of the examination have been completed  successfully, the student is recommended for admission to candidacy for  the degree. The examination may be taken no more than three times. All components of the examinations must be completed within 14 months. Further  information pertaining to the doctoral qualifying examinations is  included in the DMA Performance Handbook, which may be downloaded from  the College of Music graduate advising web site: music.unt.edu/advising/graduate.php.

Jazz Studies majors Following successful completion of the written qualifying  examinations, the student is required to complete a research project and  pass a two-hour oral examination that includes questioning on the  research project and on other areas appropriate to the degree. It is  understood that the student may consult the Advisory Committee and the  library, and that no other form of assistance is acceptable. The  student's Advisory Committee will consist of the jazz studies graduate  advisor, the student's applied professor, one additional member of the  jazz studies faculty selected by the student, one member of the  musicology or music theory faculty (determined by the field in which the  student took six hours in the musicology/music theory component), and  one faculty member representing the student's related field (if the  related field is other than musicology or music theory). The Advisory  Committee administers this combined oral examination. When all three parts of the examination (written examination in major  field, written examination in related field, and research project/oral  examination) have been completed successfully, the student is  recommended for admission to candidacy for the degree. Each examination  may be taken no more than three times. All components of the  examinations must be completed within 14 months.
