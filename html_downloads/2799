Admission and general degree requirementsAdmission requirements Before being admitted to the master's program, the applicant must meet the requirements for admission to the Toulouse Graduate School specified in the Admission section of this catalog. Applying is a two-part process. First, prospective applicants for a master's program must obtain and file an application for admission to the UNT Toulouse Graduate School. Second, applicants for a master's degree must also obtain and file a separate application for admission to the program. A competitive score on the general test of the Graduate Record Examination must be submitted. No specific undergraduate major is required. General degree requirements The Master of Science with a major in health services administration requires completion of 36 graduate hours. These 36 hours include an 18 hour core curriculum, 15 concentration hours and a 3 credit elective. Students must complete a capstone course prior to completion of the program. The capstone requires a comprehensive research project covering the student's field of specialization. The project is designed to demonstrate the student's mastery of the discipline and ability to apply knowledge acquired throughout the program to solve a real world problem in the student's area of specialization under faculty supervision.
