These problems will likely escalate as populations grow throughout the 21st century. This track under the Master's of Science in Applied Geography (MSAG) enables students to structure their degree plans around scientific, technical and political aspects of water resources management. The track meets all existing requirements of the MSAG (including courses in research design, geographic theory, quantitative techniques and a cognate field). Students completing this track may find employment with government research and regulatory agencies, municipalities, planning organizations, water supply districts or environmental consulting firms. To complete an optional minor, two courses may be selected that have a single prefix other than GEOG/GEOL.  Required Courses GEOG 5160 Foundations of Geographic Thought (3) GEOG 5190 Advanced Quantitative Techniques (3) GEOG 5800 Research Design and Geographic Applications (3) GEOG 5190 is the department's primary course to fulfill our MS program's analytical methods requirement.  However, where individual student interests warrant, an alternative methods course may be selected by the major professor and must be approved by the Geography Graduate Committee.
