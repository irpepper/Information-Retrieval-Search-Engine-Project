Ruth was a scholarship pupil of Marcel Grandjany at the Juilliard School of Music and graduated with highest honors as a winner of the prestigious Damrosch Scholarship.  While still a student at Juilliard she performed with the New York City Opera, RCA and CBS Orchestras with Fritz Reiner, Leopold Stowkowski, Wilfred Pelletier, Pierre Monteux, Donald Voorhees, and Andre Kostelanetz before beginning a nine year engagement as principal harp of the New York City Ballet Co. in 1950. Ms. Negri joined the New York Philharmonic in 1969, and retired in June 1997.  She has been a soloist with the New York Philharmonic Ensembles and remains active as a soloist and chamber music performer.  In 1970-71 and 1986-87 she took sabbaticals from the New York Philharmonic when she was invited to play principal harp with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.  In 1987 she was soloist in a TV special of Donizetti\u2019s \u201cLucia\u201d with the Metropolitan Opera. From 1950-to the present Ms. Negri has been active as a teacher, coach, and performer (Williamsburg Settlement House, Manhattan School of Music, and privately).  She has also been an adjudicator (American Harp Society, NY Philharmonic, Manhattan School of Music, Juilliard and Concert Artists Guild).  She has played for many commercials, soap operas (General Hospital, 15 years), numerous TV specials and over 30 films (including Miracle Worker, Indian in the Cupboard) Ruth lives in Hartsdale, New York with her husband Ben Armato, retired Clarinetist of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra.   They have three daughters, six grandchildren and two great grandchildren. One of her greatest joys has been working with composers, sharing with them the \u201cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201d of writing for harp\u2026 notably Ellen Taffe Zwilich, Dave Brubeck, Ray Sebesky and Derek Bermel.  Ellen Zwilich dedicated her \u201c4 Nocturnes for Harp\u201d to Ruth and gave the first performance of them at Juilliard in 1974.
