Among other groups, we hope to attract students with diverse backgrounds who have been historically underrepresented in anthropology. This program was created by the UNT anthropology faculty using innovative pedagogical designs that maintain the rigor of a fully face-to-face program while making it more accessible. We offer both an MA and an MS degree in Applied Anthropology. Accreditation UNT has a large number of online courses, and the department draws heavily on this great pool of knowledge when developing and revising our online program. The department of anthropology is a member in good standing of the American Anthropological Association as well as the Consortium of Practicing and Applied Anthropology Programs. The University of North Texas is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award baccalaureate, masters and doctorate degrees. Contact the Commission on Colleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, Georgia 30033-4097 or call 404-679-4500 for questions about the accreditation of the University of North Texas. Note: The Commission should be contacted only if there is evidence that appears to support the institution's significant non-compliance with a requirement or standard. Normal inquiries about UNT, such as admission requirements, financial aid, and educational programs, should be addressed directly to UNT and not the Commission's office. Program Trajectory The program can be completed in three years. In order to do so, students take two classes each fall and spring semester, for a total of twelve classes. The workload was designed to be manageable for students who are juggling work, family, and educational responsibilities. If applying for financial aid, you may have to enroll full time (3 courses/semester). All courses are fully online. Students are required to come to the UNT campus twice. At the beginning of the program, there is a two-day on-campus orientation for new students. At the end of their final semester, all graduating students come to UNT to give a verbal presentation about their applied thesis project, and share in each others' successes. Quote from a new student:"You \u2026 have crafted such a well-designed program that provides accountability for both of us, not to mention a terrific breadth of courses\u2026 I am also looking forward to the mentoring and guidance you offer. It is what will separate those who obtain a degree, from those who ultimately get a job. This is exactly what was lacking for me at [university]. I cannot thank you enough."
