The graduate program is designed to enable students to follow either of two career paths upon graduation:  Professional employment in the applied field: conduct behavioral assessments and behavioral interventions in human service, educational or business settings; train employees in program interventions and conduct applied research in public and private agencies and institutions; or Doctoral study in behavior analysis: enter PhD programs at other universities to continue advanced study in applied behavior analysis or the experimental analysis of behavior.  Students focusing in either area will take courses from a core curriculum, take elective courses tailored to their interests and complete a thesis. Students with disabilities should contact the department office for the name of the graduate advisor. Degree requirements Students focusing on application will complete 48 semester hours, including 24 hours of core courses and thesis, designated and free elective courses, and 7 hours of practicum/internship. Others will complete 42 semester hours of work in the same categories, but will have one 2-hour practicum. Full- or part-time study is possible, as long as a satisfactory pace is maintained. Ordinarily, students will take a minimum of 6 hours per term/semester and finish in five to eight terms/semesters.           Return to: Degrees, Certificates, Teacher Certifications Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page Add to My Catalog               All catalogs © 2017 University of North Texas.
