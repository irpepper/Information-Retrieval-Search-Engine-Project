Her dissertation research project examined practices of hypertension management of San Francisco transit operators and offered a critique of the "stress" literature. More recently she has been involved in collaborative applied projects. For example, in 2010-11, she worked with other professors at UNT and TWU studying choice architecture in middle school lunchrooms. In her role as undergraduate program director she has a very strong interest in ensuring a comprehensive experience for anthropology majors, including research experience and post-college planning and advice. Other interests include the anthropology of work, urban anthropology, communication processes in medical care, medical professional socialization processes, and the anthropology of 'beauty' and body image.
