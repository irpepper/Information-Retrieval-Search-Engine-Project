This unique program accepts credits earned from military training or from an Associate of Applied Science degree. It may also facilitate graduation for students who are returning to college after spending time in the workplace. Interested students should contact the Department of Community and Professional Programs or the Advising Office in the College of Public Affairs and Community Service.        Degree requirements for the BAAS Hours required and general/college requirements: A minimum of 120 semester hours, of which 36 must be advanced, and fulfillment of degree requirements for the Bachelor of Applied Arts and Sciences degree as specified in the "General University Requirements" in the Academics section of this catalog and the College of Public Affairs and Community Service requirements. Major requirements: Occupational specialization, 21 Hours:  Comprised of courses related to a specific occupation, field or subject. The occupational specialization typically consists of field-specific course work completed for an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree at a community college. Active-duty military or veterans may receive credit for technical or other formal training courses under this component of the degree plan. Other students who have not completed an occupational specialization through courses taken in a community college or in the military may create one by selecting a primary area of study. Professional foundations, 9 Hours: Specific courses from the College of Public Affairs and Community Service approved by the BAAS program director that teach students to sharpen their ability to communicate, negotiate, analyze information and network effectively. A minimum 2.0 grade point average is required for the professional foundations component. Students must earn a C or better in each of the courses in this component to receive credit toward the degree. Professional development concentrations, 36 Hours:  Consists of two or three separate multidisciplinary concentrations, developed in collaboration between the BAAS program and the appropriate disciplinary units. Each concentration will consist of a minimum of 12 credit hours that serve to enhance the skills a student has acquired through prior education or are complimentary to the student's career plans. Minor requirements: None required. Electives: Varies with individual program. Any approved UNT courses the student and advisor deem appropriate to the degree may be selected. Caution must be exercised to ensure the student fulfills the university requirement of 36 hours of advanced-level course work. Other requirements:  a total of 36 hours of upper-division work at least 24 hours of upper-division work in residence      NoteA lower-level transfer course that is determined to be equivalent to a UNT upper-level course does not satisfy the requirement for advanced hours.       Return to: Majors, minors, certificates Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page Add to My Catalog               All catalogs © 2017 University of North Texas.
