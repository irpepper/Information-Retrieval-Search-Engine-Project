Partnerships Each partnership is unique and individual, but we often categorize partnerships on a scale of complexity and level of expertise required. 1.0 Experiences:  Simple, low impact activities that require little specialized knowledge, training or resources Example: One-day service opportunity for students Example: Community partners presenting to student groups or classes  2.0 Experiences:  Mid-level impact activities that are more than a one-day event, require some specialized knowledge, training and resources (e.g. background checks) Example: Course projects like Emergency Management and Disaster Science students developing an emergency operations plan for our local nonprofits Example: Research projects like students assessing neighborhood blight and providing that information to the City of Denton for data based decision making Example: UNT Serves students implementing a food drive  3.0 Experiences:  High impact activities that require specialized knowledge, significant training and oversight by both faculty and community partner and resources Example: Community partner serves as an internship or practicum site\u200b  Learn more about experiential learning opportunities within the College                          Visit Us  Chilton Hall       410 S.
