Most of these cohorts are grants funded and are offered in collaboration with local organizations.  In 1999, The Master of Science program and UNT became the first in the nation to offer the Learning Resource Endorsement online. The program met with immediate success. In Spring 2001, enrollment increased 40% over the previous spring due to the popularity of the Web based courses. In response to the needs of students pursuing all or part of their program in distance learning mode, the department maintained the requirement for face to face meetings and launched the first Onsite Institute in June 2001. The Onsite Institutes in the form of face to face meetings have now become an integral and required part of the learning experience for all students working toward the master\u2019s degree. In 1999, the department began offering the master\u2019s degree at out-of-state locations in collaboration with local institutions. The first cohort was offered in Minnesota, when the department collaborated with St. Cloud State University and University of Minnesota Law Library. In 2001, the department collaborated with the University of Nevada Las Vegas and began the first Nevada Cohort in 2002. The out-of-state programs continued to thrive with the Institute of Musuem and Library Services (IMLS) grant-based cohorts in Nevada and Utah, Georgia, and the Pacific Islands. The Nevada/Utah Cohort was funded by two Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian grants awarded in 2003 through a collaboration with the Nevada State Library, UNLV, and the Las Vegas/Clark County Library District.  In 2004, IMLS awarded the department a grant to recruit 20 bilingual students to complete a master\u2019s degree online. The program was designed to help alleviate the problem of unfilled professional positions in both academic and public libraries along the Texas and New Mexico border. This was followed by the Georgia Cohort, SWIM (South Dakota, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana) and the LEAP (Library Education for the U.S. Affiliated Pacific) cohorts. The LEAP cohort covers American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia including the states of Chuuk, Kosrai, Pohnpei, and Yap, and the Republic of Palau. The graduates of this cohort were the first native Pacific Islanders to earn master's degrees in library and information science. The ELMS (Educating Librarians in the Middle South) was funded by IMLS and began in January 2013. The cohort was a partnership with UNT Libraries and in collaboration with the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). The purpose of the grant was to increase the number and the diversity of librarians and information stewards in the Middle South region for the rapidly changing library science and digital curation field.  Thirty students enrolled in the UNT master's program for training in 21st Century library skills with an emphasis on digital content management. The LIS Master's program continues to have a strong presence across the country, with cohorts currently being offered in Virginia, West Virginia, Greater Los Angeles, Northern California, Nevada and Utah, Arkansas and Tennessee, New Mexico, Lubbock/Amarillo, El Paso, and Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.      Top                          Main Menu Home About Us People Programs Students Financial Assistance Research Alumni  University Links  MyUNT Blackboard EagleConnect UNT Directory UNT Map Jobs at UNT  Email & Phone   CI-Advising@unt.edu  940-565-2445    Department of Information Science    University Services Building (USB)   3940 North Elm, Suite E292           Denton , Texas 76203-5017   Visitor Information  Call us Email Us UNT Map                Apply now Schedule a tour Get more info   Disclaimer | AA/EOE/ADA | Privacy | Electronic Accessibility | Required Links | UNT Home ©2017 University of North Texas Required Links
