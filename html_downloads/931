Welcome to Stop #8 on your Student Tech Tour. If you do not reside in a UNT Residence Hall, you may wish to proceed to Stop #9: Copyright, IT and You. Here you will learn about how to sign up for wireless connectivity in the UNT Residence Halls. Connectivity in the residence halls is provided for residents' convenience, where small student computer labs also are provided. All housing areas feature wireless and wired-networking in the individual rooms.   Background: The University of North Texas has partnered with Apogee, an Austin-based provider of on-campus residential networks in higher education, in order to provide residential network service. All residence halls have fast, reliable Internet connectivity and 24/7 customer support through Apogee's service called MyResNet. Apogee also provides UNT students, who live on campus in the residence halls, high-speed access to the university\u2019s networked services. Access to services outside the campus network through the Internet are provided at 2 Mbps, megabits per second, download. Each student has the option to upgrade to faster speeds through the MyResNet website for an upgrade fee.  Sign Up: Obtain your Apogee account through the MyResNet portal:  http://myresnet.com. Click on the \u201cSign Up" button on the webpage and follow the on-screen instructions. Upon completion of the sign-up process, you will be assigned an Apogee username and password. NOTE: Keep your username and password information confidential, secure and do not share it with anyone. For Apogee's MyResNet Assistance or Support: Representatives are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Call Toll Free:  1-877-478-8804 Visit the MyResNet online support site.  Some restrictions do apply to the service in order to maximize the efficiency of this community resource. Routers, access points and other devices can interfere with network equipment and are not allowed on ResNet.  Two Important Policies Apogee Policy: Students who obtain an Apogee/MyResNet account must abide by Apogee\u2019s policies as well as UNT's Computer-Use Policy. You can view Apogee\u2019s end-user agreement at www.myresnet.com/pdf/eua.pdf.  UNT Policy: UNT's Computer-Use Policy at https://policy.unt.edu/policydesc/computer-use-policy-3-10. <<< Return to beginning of tour   |   Next stop on the tour >>> Please participate in the Help Desk Client Feedback Survey.
