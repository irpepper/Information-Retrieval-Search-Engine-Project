The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in electrical engineering is an innovative undergraduate program designed to combine the best practices in electrical engineering education. This design- and project-oriented program integrates concepts, analysis, design and development of state-of-the-art electrical and electronic systems. Through course work, students have "learning-to-learn" experiences and work on hands-on design projects every semester. This active learning experience emphasizes knowledge and skills so that students can solve real-world electrical engineering problems. The one-year sequence of business and marketing courses encourages students to develop a global markets outlook. The courses in the program are designed to cover both the breadth and depth of electrical engineering. The breadth of the curriculum is provided through course work in circuits, signals and systems, logic design, electromagnetics, electronics, communications, and analog and digital design projects. The depth of the curriculum is provided through courses in electronics, computer organization, computer networks, VLSI design, and advanced elective courses. Project courses in digital signal processing and communication system design provide additional depth. The design projects are integrated into the course work so that students can learn to solve practical engineering problems in a creative and relevant setting. In addition, project courses ensure that students have an opportunity to solve multidisciplinary engineering problems by working in teams and to develop effective oral and written communication skills. The program also puts a strong emphasis on studies in art, business, management, humanities, physics and chemistry, social sciences, professionalism and engineering ethics, which fulfill objectives appropriate to the electrical engineering profession. The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in electrical engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET (abet.org), (111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202; 410-347-7700). Degree requirements     Hours required and general/college requirementsA minimum of 128 semester hours, of which 42 must be advanced courses, and fulfillment of degree requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree as specified in the "General University Requirements and the University Core Curriculum " in the Academics section of this catalog and in the College of Engineering  section of this catalog.Major requirementsA minimum of 36 semester hours, including:EENG 2610 - Circuit AnalysisEENG 2620 - Signals and SystemsEENG 2710 - Digital Logic DesignEENG 3410 - Engineering ElectromagneticsEENG 3510 - Electronics I (Devices and Materials)EENG 3520 - Electronics IIEENG 3710 - Computer OrganizationEENG 3810 - Communications SystemsFour electrical engineering electives.
