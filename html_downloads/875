Parking is an auxiliary operation. It receives no direct funding from either the State of Texas or the University. As such, the program operates through permits, fines, and fees generated by students, faculty/staff, and visitors who choose to park on campus.      Where does my permit or citation money go?    Major uses of parking funds include: parking lot maintenance and construction, parking and traffic activities related to special events management, police and security-related operations; including, post 9/11 and Virginia Tech continuing security enhancements, and operation and enforcement of parking lots in accordance with our parking rules and regulations.

Our costs to provide and operate our parking program have increased significantly: ·         Asphalt for repaving \u2013 on average increased 74% with significant expected increases as oil prices continue to rise in the marketplace ·         Cement for concrete paving \u2013 on average increased 160% with additional increases expected in the short term ·         Labor and Benefit Costs \u2013 increased an average of 26% ·         Surface Lot parking spaces \u2013 costs generally range from $2,000 - $6,000 per space to construct ·         Parking Garage spaces \u2013 costs generally range from $12,000 - $20,000 per space to construct Priorities and progress towards the UNT Master Plan -  As we move into the future, our UNT Master Plan directs us to continue developing our academic and institutional facilities in such a manner that we\u2019ll be required to build new parking lots located on the South side of campus. Each new lot will range between $3M and $5M. Because garages and structures are extremely expensive to build and operate, the Master Plan encourages significant growth and support of other transportation options; such as shuttle buses, bicycles, carpools, vanpools, the proposed DCTA rail system, etc. to help us continue to reduce the need for individually operated motor vehicles on campus.      Why are parking permit rates different for various types of permits?   Permit prices are established based upon a number of factors, primarily including: ·         Location of spaces \u2013 the closer or more preferred the location the more expensive. The same principle is used at the airport where \u2018terminal\u201d parking is significantly more expensive than \u201cremote\u201d parking. ·         Privilege conferred by permit \u2013 \u201cA\u201d spaces are individually reserved spaces and carry a premium of 200% over the cost of regular faculty/staff  \u201cF/S\u201d and Eagle spaces which are in preferred locations but only provide a space \u201cas available.\u201d      Friendly Reminders    ·         It is possible to attend UNT for four (4) years, park on campus every day and never receive a parking ticket if you comply with the parking rules and regulations. ·         We always have parking available on class days; however, that parking may not be next to the building or the individual\u2019s parking lot of choice. ·         We encourage the use of the shuttle system, car pools, bicycling, walking, etc. to save money, time wasted in traffic, reduce vehicle emissions, and reduce fuel demand.
