The 15-semester-hour program includes 12 semester hours of core courses covering social, physiological and psychological aspects of aging as well as government programs for the elderly, plus 3 elective hours of applied gerontology. For students who have successfully completed the Coalition for Leadership in Aging Services certification program jointly sponsored by the Department of Sociology and the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, the 3 elective hours will be waived.
