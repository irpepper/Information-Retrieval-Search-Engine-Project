I've done research in areas such as sleep and the treatment-seeking behaviors surrounding sleep disorders, violence, refugees, and international relief during conflict and disaster, program evaluation through "cost-benefit analyses," structural violence and the public health of young gay and bisexual men, paramedical decision-making, and the "cruising" culture of looking for sex partners in Internet chat rooms. I currently teach the undergraduate courses Introduction to Sociocultural Anthropology, Peoples and Cultures of Africa, and Field Methods, and the graduate courses Medical Anthropology and Quantitative Methods and Analyses.
