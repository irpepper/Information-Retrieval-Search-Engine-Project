Step 1: Toulouse Graduate School application Apply through the Toulouse Graduate School at www.applytexas.org. See the Admission  section of this catalog for Toulouse Graduate School application and admission requirements, or go to the graduate school web site at gradschool.unt.edu/admissions/programs. All requirements, including GPA, must be met before the department can begin reviewing an application. Step 2: Departmental application requirements  Submission of official GRE scores is required: verbal, quantitative and analytical writing sections. The department views high GRE scores as positive indicators of potential success in the programs, within a competitive holistic framework for evaluating the applicants. Applicants are encouraged to aim for at least the 50th percentile in all three sections. GRE scores must be sent electronically from ETS, institutional code 6481. Applicants must submit scores that are less than five years old, with exceptions for those who have a completed master's degree from UNT. Resources can be found at www.ets.org, as well as study materials in most book stores. Current UNT students can also participate in exam preparation workshops through the Learning Center. At least two written letters of recommendation for master's applicants and at least three for doctoral applicants. These letters should be sent from the reference, signed and on official letterhead. Academic references are strongly preferred and should be in an appropriate position to make recommendation (current or former advisor or professor; school administrator). Professionally applicable sources are accepted, but are not preferred. These letters should address potential as a graduate student; include references to how applicant will benefit from the graduate program in future professional roles; provide evidence of the applicant's reading, critical thinking, writing and mathematical skills; and attest to applicant's professional and academic skills. Professional resume that delineates previous work, educational experiences, membership and involvement in professional organizations, and scholarly activities. Resume should support potential for strong performance as a graduate student. A personal statement (1\u20133 pages) is required, stating your goals and rationale for applying to the desired degree program and concentration area. In this statement, you may include a brief description of your career experiences (teaching, working with special populations, etc.), and explain how they are linked to your educational aspirations. Also, if you have any research and/or evaluation experiences, please summarize these and relate them to your degree and concentration. Your personal statement should be well articulated and demonstrate professional writing quality (formal; accurate grammar and spelling). The educational diagnostician concentration also requires a copy of your teaching certificate, two years of experience as a fully-licensed teacher, and the Policy Manual signature page found on the Department of Educational Psychology admissions page at www.coe.unt.edu/educational-psychology/doctoral-and-masters-admissions. All departmental application materials, including official GRE scores, must be received within two months of the submitted online application.  All departmental admission decisions are based on a holistic review of the applicant's submitted materials, including GPA, GRE scores, etc. Applicants that are strong in all areas will have first priority of admission.        Return to: Degrees, Certificates, Teacher Certifications Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page Add to My Catalog               All catalogs © 2017 University of North Texas.
