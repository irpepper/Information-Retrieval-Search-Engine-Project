The IIG recommends strategies to academic affairs and the university at-large that aid in setting, refining, and achieving UNT\u2019s goals in India and that contribute to UNT attaining Tier One status. The philosophy of the IIG is to enhance UNT\u2019s successful engagements and visibility and India beyond individual UNT faculty/staff relationships. The IIG identified four thrust areas for furthering UNT\u2019s engagements in India, including: Student Engagement (Ila Manuj) Research Engagement (STEM \u2013 Raj Banerjee, Humanities/Social Sciences \u2013 Pankaj Jain) Local Community Engagement \u2013 (Niranjan Tripathy) Marketing (Pankaj Jain) Please direct any inquiries about the IIG or requests to join the UNT-India listserv to Amanda.White@unt.edu.            India Initiatives Meeting Minutes India Initiatives Members India Venture Fund International Student Organizations                                  Visit Us  Marquis Hall        1511 West Mulberry Street Marquis Hall, Room 105 Denton, TX 76201         Mail Us   University of North Texas       1155 Union Circle, #311067 Denton, TX 76203-5017 USA       Contact Us   940-565-2197 amanda.guccione@unt.edu Technical issues?
