Students who earn the degree enjoy being part of a close-knit professional community that bridges disciplines, such as applied physics and chemistry, in order to solve complex engineering problems.  The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in materials science and engineering is designed to provide students with the fundamental principles of how materials are made, how they behave during application, how their structure and properties are measured and quantified, and how to improve the performance of these materials. This information is then used in "materials-specific" courses and hands-on laboratories where students then learn to apply these principles to the different materials classes, namely, metals, ceramics, polymers, electronic materials and biomaterials. Students also learn about nanotechnology and how it is impacting the materials science and engineering discipline. During their last year, students are required to do a senior project with one of the faculty members who specialize in their primary area of interest. Students work either individually or in small groups on projects that provide them with research experiences that help them determine whether they feel better suited to finish their education and go to industry or continue on to graduate school. The course work instills in students ethical and environmental issues and standards expected by industry and society. The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in materials science and engineering is a new program designed to meet ABET criteria. Accreditation for this degree is being sought. Degree requirements     Hours required and general/college requirementsA minimum of 120 semester hours, of which 45 must be advanced, and fulfillment of degree requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree as specified in the \u201cUniversity Core Curriculum \u201d in the Academics section of this catalog and the College of Engineering  requirements.Major requirementsA minimum of 52 semester hours, including: MTSE 1100 - Discover How and Why Materials "Matter"MTSE 3010 - Bonding and StructureMTSE 3020 - Microstructure and Characterization of MaterialsMTSE 3030 - Thermodynamics and Phase DiagramsMTSE 3040 - Transport Phenomena in MaterialsMTSE 3050 - Mechanical Properties of MaterialsMTSE 3060 - Phase Transformations in MaterialsMTSE 3070 - Electrical, Optical and Magnetic Properties of MaterialsMTSE 3080 - Materials ProcessingMTSE 3090 - Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory IMTSE 3100 - Materials Science and Engineering Laboratory IIMTSE 4010 - Physical Metallurgy PrinciplesMTSE 4030 - Ceramic Science and EngineeringMTSE 4050 - Polymer Science and EngineeringMTSE 4060 - Materials Selection and PerformanceMTSE 4090 - Senior Design IMTSE 4100 - Senior Capstone ProjectMTSE electives (6 hours)Other required coursesCHEM 1410 - General Chemistry for Science MajorsCHEM 1420 - General Chemistry for Science MajorsCHEM 1430 - Laboratory Sequence for General ChemistryENGR 2301 - StaticsENGR 2332 - Mechanics of MaterialsENGR 3450 - Engineering MaterialsMATH 1710 - Calculus IMATH 1720 - Calculus IIMATH 2700 - Linear Algebra and Vector GeometryMATH 3410 - Differential Equations IPHYS 1710 - MechanicsPHYS 1730 - Laboratory in MechanicsPHYS 2220 - Electricity and MagnetismPHYS 2240 - Laboratory in Wave Motion, Electricity, Magnetism and OpticsPHYS 3010 - Modern PhysicsTECM 2700 - Technical WritingMinorOptional.ElectivesHours required for electives may vary based on course selection and the University Core Curriculum requirements. Electives may be required to satisfy the advanced hour requirement (45) and/or the minimum total hours required for the degree. For specific information see an academic advisor in the College of Engineering.Other requirementsA grade point average of at least 2.0 is required for all materials science and engineering courses. MTSE foundation courses include MTSE 1100 , MATH 1710 , MATH 1720 , CHEM 1410 /CHEM 1430 , CHEM 1420 , PHYS 1710 /PHYS 1730 , TECM 2700  and ENGR 3450 . Satisfactory completion of the MTSE foundation courses with a minimum GPA of 2.5 is prerequisite to taking advanced courses in the major. Each semester the student is required mandatory advisement until the foundation courses have been successfully completed.        Return to: College of Engineering Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page Add to My Catalog               All catalogs © 2017 University of North Texas.
