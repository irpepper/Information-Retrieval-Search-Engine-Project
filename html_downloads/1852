Thus, the BS degree combines the fundamentals of mechanical engineering with a broad specialization on subjects related to energy production, management, and distribution. The goal of the mechanical and energy engineering department is to provide a curriculum and course of training that will prepare undergraduates not only for today\u2019s challenges, but also for future challenges in a fast-paced, global, and diverse society. As a consequence, this program emphasizes the fundamentals, modern methods, processes and technologies of engineering science. It also gives students the tools to learn by themselves and to pursue lifelong learning. Graduates of this program are well-prepared for industry careers and pursuit of advanced engineering degrees. The mechanical and energy engineering curriculum is very broad. It is similar to a traditional mechanical engineering curriculum with the notable addition of several required energy-related courses and elective courses that emphasize energy applications and materials. In their first year, students in this program will take preparatory courses in mathematics and the basic sciences, including physics, computer science and chemistry. The required upper-division engineering courses are in the broad areas of energy-thermal-fluid science; mechanics and materials; dynamics, design and controls; and environmental impact of energy production and use. Technical elective courses range from alternative energy to nuclear power. The program also emphasizes studies in the humanities and social sciences, artistic ingenuity, professionalism, technical communication and engineering ethics. The department also offers unique curriculum-integrated enrichment opportunities including undergraduate research, co-ops, and study abroad exchanges with international partner schools. Minors that provide breadth of experience from other disciplines, including mathematics and hospitality management, can also be integrated seamlessly into the department\u2019s four-year bachelor\u2019s degree plan. The BS degree with a major in mechanical and energy engineering is the newest program in the College of Engineering at the University of North Texas. The curriculum of this program has been designed to meet the ABET criteria for accreditation in the general category of \u201cMechanical Engineering.\u201d According to the ABET procedures, accreditation for this program will be sought after the program graduates its first class of students. Program Educational Objectives  Graduates will obtain employment in entry-level mechanical and energy engineering positions or enroll in advanced degree programs, which will enrich their professional practice in mechanical and energy engineering related fields. Graduates will engage in life-long learning demonstrated by advanced education/degrees, professional development activities, and/or other career-appropriate options. Graduates employed within engineering fields will demonstrate technical competence in identifying, formulating, analyzing and creating engineering solutions.  Student Outcomes Upon completion of the Bachelor of Science with a major in mechanical and energy engineering, students are enabled to achieve the following outcomes:  Apply knowledge of mathematics, engineering and science. Design and conduct experiments to verify and validate the design projects they develop and analyze and interpret data. Develop project-based learning skills through design and implementation of a system, component or process that meets the needs within realistic constraints. Function in multi-disciplinary teams. Identify, formulate and solve engineering problems. Have an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility. Communicate effectively. Achieve broad education necessary to understand the impact of mechanical and energy engineering solutions in a global and societal context. Understand learning processes and need for learning, and engage in lifelong learning. Achieve knowledge of contemporary issues. Use techniques, skills and computer-based tools for conducting experiments and carrying out designs.        Degree Requirements     Hours Required and General/College Requirements:A minimum of 127 semester hours, of which 42 must be advanced, and fulfillment of degree requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree as specified in the \u201cGeneral University Requirements \u201d in the Academics section of this catalog and the College of Engineering  requirements.Major Requirements:Engineering Fundamentals RequirementsA minimum of 24 credit hours of ENGR 1304 - Engineering GraphicsENGR 2301 - StaticsENGR 2302 - DynamicsENGR 2332 - Mechanics of MaterialsENGR 3450 - Engineering MaterialsENGR 3451 - Engineering Materials LabCSCE 1020 - Program Development ENGR 2405 - Circuit AnalysisorEENG 2610 - Circuit AnalysisMajor RequirementsA minimum of 33 credit hours, includingMEEN 1000 - Discover Mechanical and Energy EngineeringMEEN 2210 - Thermodynamics IMEEN 3110 - Thermodynamics IIMEEN 3120 - Fluid MechanicsMEEN 3130 - Machine ElementsMEEN 3210 - Heat TransferMEEN 3230 - System Dynamics and ControlMEEN 3240 - Mechanical and Energy Engineering Laboratory IMEEN 3242 - Mechanical and Energy Engineering Laboratory IIMEEN 3250 - Analytical Methods for MEE EngineersMEEN 4150 - Mechanical and Energy Engineering Systems Design IMEEN 4250 - Capstone Design in Mechanical and Energy EngineeringOther Required Courses:MATH 1710 - Calculus IMATH 1720 - Calculus IIMATH 2730 - Multivariable CalculusMATH 3410 - Differential Equations Ia MATH elective (chosen from MATH 3420 , MATH 3680   or MATH 3740 ) CHEM 1415 - General Chemistry for Engineering Majors andCHEM 1435 - General Chemistry Laboratory for Engineering Majors or CHEM 1410 - General Chemistry for Science Majors andCHEM 1420 - General Chemistry for Science MajorsandCHEM 1430 - Laboratory Sequence for General Chemistry andCHEM 1440 - Laboratory Sequence for General Chemistry PHYS 1710 - Mechanics andPHYS 1730 - Laboratory in Mechanics PHYS 2220 - Electricity and Magnetism andPHYS 2240 - Laboratory in Wave Motion, Electricity, Magnetism and Optics TECM 2700 - Technical Writing (College of Engineering Foundations requirement)Energy Engineering Electives:6 semester credit hours from a list of approved departmental energy engineering elective courses.Technical Electives:6 semester credit hours from a list of approved departmental general advanced elective courses.Other Requirements:A grade point average of at least 2.5 is required for all mechanical and energy engineering courses.
