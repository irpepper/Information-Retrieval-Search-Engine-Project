Most of our graduate courses are offered in the evening to make the program more accessible for students who work during the day. On-campus students enjoy the small size of each cohort and the opportunities to meet with other students and faculty. Program Trajectory The program can be completed in two years.  In order to do so, students take three classes each fall and spring semester, for a total of twelve classes. Quote from an on-campus student:"Although I am a commuter, the on-campus Applied Anthropology program has been beneficial in a number of ways. The supportive and easily accessible network of fellow students, faculty and staff has been an incredible resource. I've been able to make connections that I feel I may have missed in an on-line program. It's not just the content of lectures, lessons and readings but it's the type of learning that emerges from sharing physical presence; it's the brainstorm sessions during break times or the impromptu unloading of the day's stresses with fellow students. I feel very lucky to be a part of such an incredible department; it has been empowering and transformative." Degree Options Master of Arts in Applied Anthropology (36 hours)For the Master of Arts degree, students fulfill the 36 hours of degree requirements and demonstrate knowledge of a foreign language.

Master of Science in Applied Anthropology (36 hours)For the Master of Science degree, students fulfill the 36 hours of degree requirements including a course in an additional skill appropriate to their area of interest.
