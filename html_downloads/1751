The objective of this track is to train students to manage the planning and implementation of both compliance and ethical strategies for sustaining the urban environment. Participation in an internship program with an appropriate government agency or a suitable nonprofit that examines issues of specific and immediate interest to that entity is recommended. If appropriate, the results of the internship will form the basis for the student's M.S. thesis or problems in lieu of thesis.
