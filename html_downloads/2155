Works in the public domain aren\u2019t protected by copyright, so you can use them freely. Public Domain Facts  Because there are so many nuances with copyright terms and when works enter the public domain, we recommend you view the Copyright Term and the Public Domain in the United States matrix from the Cornell Copyright Information Center for details. Works in the public domain include those first published in  the United States prior to 1923, and those published between 1923 and 1978 on  which copyright registrations were not renewed.  Materials created since 1989 (other than those created by  the U.S. federal government) are probably protected by copyright.  There is a low  likelihood that materials of greatest interest are in the public domain.
