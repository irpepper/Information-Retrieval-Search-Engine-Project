His fieldwork has occurred primarily in the context of a struggle over the tourist development of a Diné (Navajo) sacred mountain: however, he has also done fieldwork with Christian religious communities. Pedagogically, Adam Dunstan focuses on enabling students' development as ethnographers as well as inculcating in them the ability to use an anthropological perspective to approaching issues. He incorporates a variety of innovative teaching methods, with a focus on increasing the relevance and accessibility of anthropological education to students who come to university with a variety of goals. He is particularly passionate about increasing the success of first-generation college students. In addition to his university teaching and research, he consults on environmental justice and cross-cultural communication issues.
