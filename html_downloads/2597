We value opportunities to program diverse events to benefit the University of North Texas community and collaborating with other organizations helps us accomplish this goal. Because UPC plans events a semester in advance, we highly recommend that you submit your Co-Sponsorship proposal as early as possible. For example if you\u2019re interested in a date that is during the spring semester, it is best to have your form turn in by late October of the previous semester. If you are looking strictly for funding for your event, and you are a student organization, please consider requesting funds from Eagle Nest sponsored by SGA Funding Request Committee. More information can be found here: http://sga.unt.edu/eagles-nest Ways in which UPC can assist your organization/department: Volunteers for the day of event If there are any bookings to be done for artists we will arrange them or help your group arrange them Provide guidance on the programming process as a whole Advertising assistance for events Assistance in obtaining facilities Possible, but in no cases exclusive, funding for the event For more information about Co-Sponsorships and to apply, please fill out the form and submit to the UPC Office, Union 345.
