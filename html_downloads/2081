Retailers know that ready-to-wear apparel is a nod to a dying experience. However, mass customization, especially for online shopping, is not easy. That may change thanks to a patented body scanning system Xu created and has been perfecting for more than 15 years. \u201cThe body scanning system is a foundation and starting point for the digital ecommerce of clothing,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause it can provide the individual body information needed for online shopping and customized products. Consumers always want clothing to have a personal fit.\u201d Completed in a half-second, a whole-body scan is done by four aligned cameras that digitally measure a person\u2019s circumference, depth and height at major body landmarks, such as the hip, neck and breasts. The data can be fed into algorithms to calculate and formulate the proper pattern pieces of a selected garment or a personally fit size for a specific brand. Individual body information also can be transmitted to a manufacturer for rapid production. The system could be a boon for retailers, enabling customers to perfectly size themselves both in store fitting rooms or online. The scanners also could be used beyond boutiques. \u201cBody scanning can have a lot of applications,\u201d says Xu, who was educated as an engineer with experience in materials property testing. The trick, says Xu, is to make the system simple, affordable and convenient so that a small business is willing to invest it. For the military, the scanners could be developed to observe the changes in soldiers\u2019 body dimensions before and after deployment, to help design uniforms that better fit soldiers, ensuring mobility and agility, or to give technologically enhanced uniforms a proper fit for the service member\u2019s equipment. The technology also could help athletes monitor the effectiveness of their physical training programs. Similarly, the scanner could provide a better outlook of one's health than the body mass index (BMI). BMI only measures total body weight and height, but this system could estimate body fat and many shape factors. Health professionals could use the body shape to identify risk factors for overall health and certain conditions like diabetes or hypertension. \u201cIn terms of image processing technology, different industries have different applications, but the foundation is the same,\u201d says Xu. \u201cThe goal is to expand the possibilities of the same technology to different applications.\u201d  \u2014 Monique Bird                           Visit Us  Hurley Administration Bldg       Hurley Admin Building, Room 210      Mail Us  Office of Research and Innovation       1155 Union Circle P.O.
