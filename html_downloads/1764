Its purpose is to confer distinction upon its members for achievement in undergraduate, graduate, and professional studies in the English language and its literature; to provide cultural stimulation on the campus and in the community; and to encourage creative and critical writing. Sigma Tau Delta facilitates academic, professional, and personal growth by providing a venue for intellectual discussion and publication in the Sigma Tau Delta creative and critical journals,The Rectangle and The Record.  More information can be found at the main Sigma Tau Delta website. Members of UNT's Tau Delta chapter have the opportunity to share their love of literature with like-minded peers, participate in community outreach activities, and be recognized for their accomplishments. They may also apply for one or more of the society's numerous awards and scholarships. In 2001, UNT's Tau Delta Chapter received the "Excellent Chapter Award" at the Sigma Tau Delta conference in Corpus Christi, Texas. Additionally, we were awarded second place in the Outstanding Website Competition in both 2003 and 2004. In 2012, Michael Winston, one of seven UNT-English students attending the Sigma Tau Delta national convention in New Orleans, won the Sigma Tau Delta Graduate Scholarship, a $4000 prize. Sigma Tau Delta offers the Graduate Scholarship in honor of Edwin L. Stockton, Jr., Past-President, who served for eighteen years. The scholarship is for students currently enrolled in an English-related graduate program who demonstrate both academic achievement and campus, community, or chapter service.
