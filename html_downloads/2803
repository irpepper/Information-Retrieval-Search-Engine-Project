In lieu of the departmental comprehensive exam, students may submit a passing score on the national certification exam for rehabilitation counselors (CRC), which must be taken the semester prior to graduation. Degree plan preparation Students are assigned an academic advisor from among the DAR faculty. The academic advisor will assist the student in developing a formal degree plan by the end of the student's second term/semester in the program. Minors The rehabilitation counseling curriculum does not usually include a minor, but some students may choose to select a minor. Program accreditation and professional certification/licensing The graduate curriculum in rehabilitation counseling is fully accredited by the Council on Rehabilitation Education (CORE) (1699 Woodfield Road, Suite 300, Schaumberg, IL 60173).  Students completing the rehabilitation counseling program are eligible to take the examination for national certification as a rehabilitation counselor (CRC). Rehabilitation counseling students are eligible for licensure as a Professional Counselor (LPC) by the Texas State Board of Examiners of Professional Counselors. Students seeking the LPC are required to complete 3,000 hours of supervised practice and must successfully pass the state licensing examination. Students may also complete academic requirements of the Texas Department of State Health Services for licensure as a Chemical Dependency Counselor (LCDC). The LCDC requires 4,000 hours of approved supervised work experience and successful completion of a state examination. Financial assistance The Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA) of the U.S. Department of Education often provides financial support to graduate students in rehabilitation to increase the number of qualified professionals in various rehabilitation counseling occupations. DRSWA is currently able to provide RSA scholarship and stipend assistance to qualified students to support their graduate studies in rehabilitation counseling. The availability of RSA financial support varies from year to year. Inquiries should be made at the time of application to the rehabilitation graduate program.       Return to: Degrees, Certificates, Teacher Certifications Back to Top | Print-Friendly Page Add to My Catalog               All catalogs © 2017 University of North Texas.
