For those in recovery, this transition often seems like an impossible one. In a social culture that often glorifies substance use, behavioral pressure and physical appearances, most students in recovery feel like they have to choose between a healthier lifestyle and their college experience. About the Program The University of North Texas\u2019 Collegiate Recovery Program (CRP) is a peer-based program created to give students in recovery the opportunity to experience college life in a safe, nurturing and substance-free environment. The program requires members to be involved with service activities, attend support groups and seminars while committing to sobriety and academics. While not all students enrolled in the program may be recovering from a substance use addiction, all students are asked to follow the same guidelines of sobriety and a healthy lifestyle. Who is the CRP for? Students recovering from substance use disorders, behavioral and process addictions, mental health concerns as well as students choosing to live a substance-free life are all welcome. Students must be enrolled in at least one class at UNT to become a member. Click here to apply to become a member. Want to Learn More?
