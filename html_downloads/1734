Her professional career started working with Maya peasants in the Yucatan and the cultural transformation associated to Maya migration towards Cancun. She is the author of The Two Milpas of Chan Kom (1996) and the video producer of an ethnographic documentary, The Maya Dreams of Chan Kom (2006), which analyzes the political, socio-economic and cultural effects of Maya migration to Cancun. On 1992, as an assistant professor of Anthropology at the University of North Texas, Alicia Re Cruz initiates her research focused on transnational migration, particularly in reference to the Latino immigrants. She has devoted the last two decades to the multi-dimensional cultural phenomenon of migration, either trans-local, in reference to rural-urban indigenous migration or trans-national in reference to migration across borders. Among the anthropological studies related to transnational migration, Alicia Re Cruz is the author of Migrant Women Crossing Borders (1998), Taquerías, Laundromats and Protestant Churches, the Landmarks of the Hispanic Barrios in Denton (2005), When Immigrants Root and Transnational Communities Grow (2005). On 1999, she started the Immigration Resource Council for Conflict Resolution a program aiming at dealing and solving issues and problems emerging from cultural clashes and misunderstandings. She was the director of this program until 2002. She has continued her professional career weaving anthropological theory and praxis. For instance, she has participated as a professor in a Bilingual Education program, teaching public school teachers how to utilize basic anthropological concepts and methods in their classrooms. The focus on applied work has brought her to explore the area of Legal Anthropology because of her applied work with VAWA (Violence against Women Act) and Human Trafficking programs. In addition, Alicia Re Cruz has adventured in numerous interdisciplinary arenas; the most current one focuses on a cross-Atlantic conversation on inter-cultural education and the repercussions of migration in education policies in both, Europe and the US.
