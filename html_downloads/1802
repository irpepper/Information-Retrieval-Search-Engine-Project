The overall objectives are for students (1) to gain an integrative perspective on education; (2) to have a firm grounding in educational theory, pedagogical practice and research methodology; (3) to engage in educational efforts focused on social justice and equity; (4) to develop research agendas to pursue in their own professional careers; and (5) to be prepared to be leaders in research and pedagogy. This 60 credit hour doctoral program has three concentration areas: curriculum studies, early childhood studies, and language and literacy studies. Admission requirements All students accepted into this doctoral program must meet admission requirements established by the Toulouse Graduate School including application form, official transcripts and test scores. Also, for admission into this program, students are expected to have competitive scores on the Graduate Record Exam (verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing); and, for applicants whose native language is not English, a score of at least 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required. Applicants must provide the following to the department:  three letters of recommendation from individuals who can address the applicant's ability to pursue doctoral-level studies and potential for contributing to a field of study related to the degree; a detailed statement of purpose describing research interests and plans and purpose for pursuing the PhD in curriculum and instruction; and a curriculum vitae demonstrating prior educational and professional experience.  Decisions about admission are based on a holistic review of the information from all these sources.
