While tannins themselves are well known, no one has ever known how plants actually put them together- until now. A team of researchers from the University of North Texas Department of Biological Sciences just made this major discovery. Now, the research by Chenggang Liu, Xiaoqiang Wang, Vladimir Shulaev and Richard Dixon, is being featured in the journal, \u201cNature Plants.\u201d \u201cThis is one of the most exciting papers of my career,\u201d said Dixon, Distinguished Research Professor of biology. \u201cI\u2019ve worked for 35 years on how plants make natural products, and now we\u2019ve answered a question that has been bothering people for many years.\u201d The researchers studied the gene leucoanthocyanidin reductase, or LAR. It was previously thought that LAR only helped make the building blocks of tannins, but the UNT research team learned that the gene instead plays an unexpected role in determining how the building blocks of tannins multiply to form long chains. When those building blocks, called epicatechin, are linked in longer chains, they become insoluble, and lose astringency. However, smaller, more soluble tannins can offer humans more health benefits. Understanding how the process works has major scientific implications.  \u201cThis is one of the biggest breakthroughs ever in tannin research,\u201d said Dixon. \u201cTannins have been associated with reduced risks of cardiovascular disease, cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. We can now use this information to try to boost those health benefits. We can also work to improve the taste and astringency of many fruits and beverages. We can even help with a major source of pollution.\u201d The pollution problem is one the UNT research team is already working to tackle. The researchers are using their new knowledge of tannins to manipulate alfalfa in a way that would reduce gas in cows, one of the biggest culprits behind the greenhouse gas problem in our environment.  \u201cThis just opens up a ton of opportunity,\u201d said Dixon. \u201cWe\u2019ve answered a big scientific question, but now we have a lot more research to do.\u201d          UNT News Service Phone Number: (940) 565-2108              Contact:         (940) 565-2943            Email:        Tanya.O'neil@unt.edu                        Follow us                   Visit Us       University Service Building    2310 N.
