Keith Company Endowed Lectureship at the University of North Texas.  Purpose  The EIR is a professional development event for hospitality and tourism management students.  It offers a continuous platform for students to learn from noted industry leaders about industry trends and professional career development.  At the conclusion of a lecture, students have the opportunity to engage in dialogue with the industry leader through a question and answer segment.   Benefit to Industry  The EIR is a tremendous opportunity for company exposure to UNT hospitality and tourism management students.  The ripple effect of this exposure includes students\u2019 recognition and interest in the company as a top employer when making career choices.  Past speakers and companies continue to be recognized at all future EIR Lectures.
