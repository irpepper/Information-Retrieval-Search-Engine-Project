A BS with a major in computer engineering provides excellent job prospects in the engineering and technology sectors.  The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in computer engineering is designed for students who wish to specialize in computer hardware, communication systems, digital signal processing, micro-controllers, real-time and embedded systems. Computer engineering students are exposed to both theoretical and practical issues of both hardware and software in laboratories with state-of-the art equipment. The program provides a strong engineering background, with an understanding of the principles and techniques of computing. A professional degree, which includes a two-term/semester senior design project sequence, prepares the graduates for a career and graduate studies in computer engineering and related fields. The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in computer engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET (abet.org), (111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202; 410-347-7700).     Educational objectivesGraduates will:  Have completed projects involving design, evaluation of materials, and management of computational and personnel resources to solve problems in multi-disciplinary teams and exhibit the ability to communicate effectively. Pursue graduate studies in computer engineering or related disciplines and careers involving VLSI design, real-time systems, communications, and networks or computer systems. Act responsibly and ethically in their professional conduct and successfully engage in life-long learning. Complete professional work assignments that exhibit a good balance between software and hardware systems, including software development, design of digital systems, microprocessors, embedded systems, real-time systems and digital communication systems.
