Dr. Duban urges graduate students to take advantage of these  opportunities.

Dr. Duban is available for that purpose. Graduate students who have yet to complete their first semester at UNT  should be especially attentive to National Science Foundation and  Jacob K. Javits Fellowships. Students who anticipate writing a doctoral  dissertation in the fall of 2000 will find several dissertation fellowships  having fall 1999 deadlines.
