Development and Diversity Women's Faculty Network (WFN)        Toulouse Scholar Award       The Toulouse Graduate School seeks nominations for the 2017-18 Toulouse Scholars Award Program. The Toulouse Scholars Award is designed to recognize the excellent teaching and scholarly/creative achievements of members of the University of North Texas faculty and thereby honor the distinguished contributions of Robert B. Toulouse to the university. Any faculty member may nominate a colleague they believe meets the criteria. Deadline: Nomination letter and nominee\u2019s current vita must be submitted to Yvette Whitworth (Yvette.Whitworth@unt.edu) by May 15, 2017 for consideration by the selection committee. Eligibility:  All full-time, tenured faculty members who are full members of the Graduate Faculty and who are not previous recipients of a Toulouse Scholars Award may be nominated. It was the intent of the Toulouse Scholars Fund Raising Committee to insure that over time, the Toulouse Scholars Award would be made to outstanding individuals from a variety of academic areas. Thus, this award cannot be given to faculty members who belong to the same voting group district for three years following the effective date of the award. Therefore, only faculty members from Groups I, II, IV, VI, and VII may be nominated: Faculty Senate Voting Groups Additionally, this award cannot be given to faculty members in the same department for five award rounds. Thus faculty in the Chemistry, English, Marketing and Logistics, Music Education, and Computer Science and Engineering departments may not be nominated. Previous five Toulouse Scholars and their department affiliations 2016-17           Saraju P. Mohanty, Computer Science and Engineering 2015-16           Deborah Rohwer, Music Education 2014-15           Audhesh Paswan, Marketing and Logistics 2013-14           Bruce Bond, English 2009-10           Angela Wilson, Chemistry   Award Amount: The awarded faculty member will receive $2,000. Award recipients may use designated funds at their discretion to enhance or further their research activities. Selection Criteria:  The primary purpose of the Toulouse Scholars Award is to recognize excellent teaching and scholarly/creative achievement. The recipient clearly should have the potential to make further contributions in both areas. Selection Committee: The selection committee will be composed of the elected faculty representatives of the Graduate Council, representing each of the eight Senate voting groups. The vice provost of the graduate school will preside over the committee, voting only to break a tie. Selection Process: Nominations may be made by any UNT faculty member and should include a nominating letter and vita. Nominating letters should demonstrate the nominee's qualifications for the award through evidence of (1) outstanding performance in teaching at the undergraduate or graduate level and scholarly/creative activity, and (2) the nominee's potential for future distinguished achievement.  The selection committee will conduct a preliminary screening of nominations to insure that the minimum criteria are met. The committee may request access to departmental records concerning any nominee's performance both as a scholar and teacher, and to records in the Office of Research and Economic Development concerning the nominee's grant history.   The 2017-18 Toulouse Scholar award recipient will be recognized at the annual Salute to Faculty Excellence dinner and ceremony in the fall.
