Short Courses and Tutorials R&SS offers the following self-paced online study guides introducing the basics of our supported statistical packages.   These study guides were initially short courses offered in a classroom twice per semester, however, they have been migrated to the online format to reach a wider audience and allow self-paced learning. These pages were designed to show how a particular software package can be used, e.g., R, SPSS, SAS; they are not designed to teach statistics or how to interpret statistics \u2013 although some interpretation is offered among the many pages. Note that these short courses are introductions for the uninitiated. If you already have notable experience with a package, you will likely not find the class offers much more than you already know.  We also are available \u2013 with adequate planning \u2013 to work out presentations tailored more to your research group's needs.   Please contact a member of the R&SS staff for more information.
