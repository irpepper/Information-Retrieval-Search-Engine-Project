ArtWear, the annual juried exhibition at the UNT Union Ballroom, located at 1155 Union Circle, Denton, is showcasing the work of 32 students from the College of Visual Arts and Design fashion design program this year. Students spend at least five months working on these pieces. They began with sketches, prototyping and research during the winter break, and they made the outfits during the spring semester.  \u201cArtWear feels more like my actual graduation \u2013 what I\u2019ve been waiting four years for,\u201d senior Brittnie Grono said. Grono was inspired by Joan of Ark\u2019s devotion to Catholicism and has created a line of modern evening/bridal suiting reflecting not only Joan of Ark\u2019s dedication but also her strength.  \u201cI\u2019m so excited for ArtWear this year,\u201d said senior Sara Bennack, who will be showing her collection of women\u2019s sportswear about falling in love that was inspired by artist Erin Armstrong, a Canadian expressionist painter. Each garment is treated with some form of hand painting, embroidery and beading, as well as carefully thought-out texture and color details. \u201cBecause this is one of my last chances to express my creativity in school, I decided to incorporate all aspects of design in my collection pieces.\u201d Showing their designs this year are:  Miranda Alkire Sara Dawn Beasley Sara Bennack Dave Cachero Rachel Coming Farrin Doganer Celia Ehrle Victoria Cedar Elms Shelby Flach Marcello Francisco Gomez III Fei Gong Brittnie Grono Ellanna Hatton Carol Patricia Hernandez Breuntonice Hickson Lizzie Jones Jin Kang Aaris Knoelle Paige Lindsey Chanira McKinney Alexandra Moran Sofia Restrepo Sencan Rika Ashley Rutherford Runa Shrestha Radkeem Sims Annabel Talavera Leticia Velazco Llanet Ventura Analisia White Mengjie Zhang Audriana Zirakchi    Tickets are $40 general admission or $25 for UNT student/faculty/staff and may be purchased online.
