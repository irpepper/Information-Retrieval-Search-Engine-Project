Graduate applicants to UNT are evaluated holistically, based on specific departmental and program requirements. In the past, successful candidates usually have met a minimum GPA of 3.00 in the undergraduate degree for admission to a master's program at UNT. Note that a 3.5 GPA in advanced undergraduate French courses is preferred. An applicant who does not meet these recommended GPA criteria will need a very strong application in order to be considered for admission into the MA-French program. See the Program Handbook (link provided below) for additional details. Students can choose from two program options: The Thesis Option requires 36 semester hours, including 6 hours of thesis; at least 24 hours of course work must be completed in the major; a minor of 6 hours is permitted. For this option, students must pass an oral defense of the thesis. The Non-Thesis Option requires 36 hours of course work; at least 30 hours must be earned in the major; a minor of 6 hours is permitted. For this option, students must pass a written comprehensive examination.
