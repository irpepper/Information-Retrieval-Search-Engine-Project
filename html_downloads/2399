In keeping with this responsibility, students, faculty and staff are free to exercise the rights to assemble and engage in expressive activity in a constitutionally protected manner subject only to the content-neutral regulations necessary to fulfill the mission and obligations of the University, preserve the rights of others, coordinate multiple uses of limited space, assure preservation of the campus facilities and grounds, and assure financial accountability for any damage caused by these activities.  See full policy (PDF):  Free Speech and Public Assembly on Campus GroundsPolicy owner: VP for Student AffairsPolicy contact:  Maureen McGuinnessDean of Students / AVP for Student AffairsDivision of Student Affairs940-565-2648Moe@unt.edu Applies to: Faculty, Staff, Students, All UniversityDate Issued: Tuesday, November 3, 2009References: Facilities Use CoordinationSigns, Posters and AdvertisementsProtection of Building and GroundsSolicitationCross-References:    Signs, Posters and Advertisements   Last updated:   Date: 2012-04-17Action: Revision    Top                          Main Menu Home FAQ Policy manual Resources Policy updates About the Policy Office  University Links  MyUNT Blackboard EagleConnect UNT Directory UNT Map UNT Calendar Jobs at UNT Give to UNT  Email & Phone   policy@unt.edu  940-565-4535    University Policy Office    Find UNT on Google Maps   1155 Union Circle #311277           Denton, Texas 76203-5017   Visitor Information  Call us Email Us UNT Map               Apply now Schedule a tour Get more info   Disclaimer | AA/EOE/ADA | Privacy | Electronic Accessibility | Required Links | UNT Home ©2017 University of North Texas Required Links
