Six students from the UNT test site scored in the top 10% of the U.S. and were invited to a second round on March 10, 2016. Those students are (back row, L-R) Wyatt Reeves, Paschal High School in Fort Worth, Hanjun Ryu, also from Paschal; and Eli Riggs, TAMS; and (front row, L-R) Sarah Freeman, TAMS; Eleanor Halbert, Denton High School; and Jocelyn Lo, Lovejoy High School. NACLO is an educational competition in Computational Linguistics, the science of designing computer algorithms to solve linguistic problems. Dr. Rodney Nielsen supervised this event, along with HiLT Ph.D. students Nishitha Guntakandla and Natalie Parde, undergraduate lab assistant Erin Eversoll and CSE Staff member Genene Murphy.
