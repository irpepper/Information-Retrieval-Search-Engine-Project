Development and Diversity Women's Faculty Network (WFN)        FacultyConnect: New Faculty Orientation - Overview       We welcome our newest faculty colleagues to the University of North Texas! We are pleased that you have joined our faculty, and we invite you to attend the New Faculty Orientation, held each August. The event, sponsored by the Office for Faculty Success, provide new full-time faculty with the necessary tools for a smooth transition to the university. There is no cost to attend, but registration is required. What topics are covered at orientation? The one-day orientation introduces new full-time faculty to the UNT leadership team, helps familiarize new faculty with campus resources, provides an overview of employee benefits programs, and presents tips for a successful first semester and career at UNT. How do I enroll for benefits, purchase parking permits, and enroll for direct deposit? Please anticipate an email from the Office of the Provost, which will provide specific directions for enrolling in direct deposit, selecting benefit and retirement options, purchasing your parking permit, and much more. What about parking during orientation? For your convenience, we ask that participants park in the Fouts Field parking lot across from the Gateway Center on North Texas Blvd. If at all possible, please purchase your UNT Faculty /Staff parking permit prior to the event. On the day of orientation, if you have not already purchased your parking permit, please proceed to the Gateway visitors booth (located in the circle drive in front of the Gateway Center) to pick up your complimentary parking pass for the day. To view a campus map, click here. I couldn't attend the scheduled New Faculty Orientation. What should I do? We strongly encourage individuals who cannot attend New Faculty Orientation to make an appointment to visit with the associate Vice Provost for Faculty (please contact Annie Garcia at 940.565.3987 or email Ana.Garcia@unt.edu for scheduling). In addition, attending the next New Faculty Orientation is a good idea. What if I have questions? If you have questions about New Faculty Orientation, please contact Annie Garcia at 940.565.3987 or email Ana.Garcia@unt.edu. Again, welcome. We look forward to meeting you in person. Congratulations on your wise decision to join our faculty and build your career at UNT.                            Visit Us  Hurley Administration Bldg        2310 N.
