The goal of the Living Learning Communities program is to enhance students\u2019 education at the University of North Texas by creating learning opportunities outside of the classroom. Besides living on a wing with other students who share the same academic interest, a Living Learning Communities resident would be able to attend programs and activities that focus on their major or thematic interest, meet and get to know UNT faculty outside of the typical professor-student environment, enroll in classes with their peers on the wing, and much more.
