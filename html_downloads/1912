The vision for the association is to provide Ph.D. students an opportunity to further their relationships both in the classroom and outside. The association has organized study groups, encouraged students to participate in department colloquiums, and of course provided a number of opportunities to mingle and have lunch and dinner together. The Department of Public Administration annually identifies an outstanding Ph.D. student who is recognized at one of the association events. Below is a list of both outstanding Ph.D. students and past association presidents.
