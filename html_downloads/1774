The Master of Arts (M.A.) in Spanish at UNT prepares students for literary and cultural analysis as well as linguistics. An M. A. in Spanish increases the salary base of many positions and offers opportunities in translation and interpretation at the local, national, and international levels. This Master's can serve as a terminal degree for those wishing to teach at the secondary, community college, and university levels. Also, graduates who wish to continue with a doctorate in Spanish at another university are well prepared. UNT professors of Spanish have specializations in all of the main areas of Latin American and Spanish literature, and students may choose from a variety of classes during their course of study. All professors publish articles and/or books in their fields of specialization, and remain active by presenting at local, national, and international professional conferences. The Department of Spanish at the University of North Texas invites you to the 2nd Annual Professional Development Day for Teachers of Spanish on SATURDAY, JUNE 17, 2017. This year's event will include multiple workshops, a Spanish conversation lunch and a special keynote speaker. Download the event information, registration form and lunch order form here.
