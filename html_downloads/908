Technical, Analytical Support for Software The R&SS group provides technical and analytical software support for a number of statistical packages.  With a focus on using R software, our staff members have much experience with the others we support as well.  While you may have access to other programs \u2013 depending on specific departments' expenditures, those listed below are the only packages supported by R&SS.  The software supported by R&SS is available in most UNT computer labs in their full version at no additional cost to students or employees. Clicking on the package links will take you to their individual pages for basic descriptions and additional resources.  A comparison of packages and other links can be found below.

The UIT Department will support home installation of these programs for graduate students who are pursuing thesis or dissertation research and require one of these programs for their research data analysis. Requests for home use must be endorsed by a professor who is guiding or sponsoring the student research activity. Students may initiate a request for home use of software by submitting a UNT System IT Help Ticket. Students are encouraged to provide sufficient contact information to enable timely communication regarding their request. For specific questions regarding license terms and conditions, please contact Jacob Flores, IT manager, host computing user services, 972-369-8232. ** Only 15 licenses for concurrent use are available for NVivo. *** STATA: Although not available for home use, UNT faculty, staff, and students are eligible for a discount when purchasing. For more information, see the Stata information page. To request software for home use, submit a UNT System IT Help Ticket: R&SS Software Request.  More to Peruse Wikipedia comparison of Statistical Software packages Strengths and weaknesses from the view of R&SS For those who do not want to pay for SPSS, take a look at PSPP, which is very similar to SPSS. You may note that PSPP is free and can handle larger data sets than SPSS. Please participate in the R&SS Client Feedback Survey.
