The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in mechanical and energy engineering follows an interdisciplinary and innovative curriculum that combines essentials of the classical discipline of mechanical engineering with the deeper knowledge of the dynamic field of energy studies. Thus, the BS degree combines the fundamentals of mechanical engineering with a broad specialization on subjects related to energy production, management, and distribution. The goal of the mechanical and energy engineering department is to provide a curriculum and course of training that will prepare undergraduates not only for today's challenges, but also for future challenges in a fast-paced, global, and diverse society. As a consequence, this program emphasizes the fundamentals, modern methods, processes and technologies of engineering science. It also gives students the tools to learn by themselves and to pursue lifelong learning. Graduates of this program are well-prepared for industry careers and pursuit of advanced engineering degrees. The mechanical and energy engineering curriculum is very broad. It is similar to a traditional mechanical engineering curriculum with the notable addition of several required energy-related courses and elective courses that emphasize energy applications and materials. In their first year, students in this program will take preparatory courses in mathematics and the basic sciences, including physics, computer science and chemistry. The required upper-division engineering courses are in the broad areas of energy-thermal-fluid science; mechanics and materials; dynamics, design and controls; and environmental impact of energy production and use. Technical elective courses range from alternative energy to nuclear power. The program also emphasizes studies in the humanities and social sciences, artistic ingenuity, professionalism, technical communication and engineering ethics. The department also offers unique curriculum-integrated enrichment opportunities including undergraduate research, co-ops, and study abroad exchanges with international partner schools. Minors that provide breadth of experience from other disciplines, including mathematics and hospitality management, can also be integrated seamlessly into the department's four-year bachelor's degree plan. The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in mechanical and energy engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET (abet.org), (111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202; 410-347-7700). Program educational objectives  Graduates are successfully employed in mechanical and energy engineering positions and other related fields. Graduates engage in lifelong learning demonstrated by advanced education, professional development activities and/or other career-appropriate options. Graduates successfully demonstrate technical and leadership competence.  Student outcomes Upon completion of the Bachelor of Science with a major in mechanical and energy engineering, students are enabled to achieve the following outcomes: (a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science and engineering (b) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data (c) an ability to design a system, component or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability and sustainability (d) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams (e) an ability to identify, formulate and solve engineering problems (f) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility (g) an ability to communicate effectively (h) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental and societal context (i) a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in, life-long learning (j) a knowledge of contemporary issues (k) an ability to use the techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice Degree requirements     Hours required and general/college requirementsA minimum of 127 semester hours, of which 42 must be advanced, and fulfillment of degree requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree as specified in the \u201cUniversity Core Curriculum \u201d in the Academics section of this catalog and the College of Engineering  requirements.Major requirementsEngineering fundamentals requirementsA minimum of 10 credit hours of ENGR 1304 - Engineering GraphicsENGR 3450 - Engineering MaterialsENGR 3451 - Engineering Materials Lab ENGR 2405 - Circuit AnalysisorEENG 2610 - Circuit AnalysisMajor requirementsA minimum of 50 credit hours, including MEEN 1000 - Discover Mechanical and Energy EngineeringMEEN 2110 - Engineering Data AnalysisMEEN 2210 - Thermodynamics IMEEN 2240 - Programming for Mechanical EngineersMEEN 2301 - Mechanics IMEEN 2302 - Mechanics IIMEEN 2332 - Mechanics IIIMEEN 3100 - Manufacturing ProcessesMEEN 3110 - Thermodynamics IIMEEN 3120 - Fluid MechanicsMEEN 3130 - Machine ElementsMEEN 3210 - Heat TransferMEEN 3230 - System Dynamics and ControlMEEN 3240 - Mechanical and Energy Engineering Laboratory IMEEN 3242 - Mechanical and Energy Engineering Laboratory IIMEEN 3250 - Analytical Methods for MEE EngineersMEEN 4150 - Mechanical and Energy Engineering Systems Design IMEEN 4250 - Capstone Design in Mechanical and Energy EngineeringEnergy engineering electives6 semester credit hours from the following coursesMEEN 3125 - Thermal Engineering ProjectsMEEN 4110 - Alternative Energy SourcesMEEN 4112 - Fundamentals of Nuclear EngineeringMEEN 4300 - Intermediate ThermodynamicsMEEN 4310 - Intermediate Heat TransferMEEN 4315 - Nanoscale Energy Transport ProcessMEEN 4320 - Mechanical Systems for BuildingsMEEN 4330 - Introduction to Combustion Science and EngineeringMEEN 4332 - Fundamentals of Air Pollution EngineeringMEEN 4335 - Computational Simulation of Building Energy SystemsMEEN 4340 - Energy Efficiencies and Green Building Design for Commercial BuildingsMEEN 4350 - Energy Efficiencies and Green Building for Residential BuildingsMEEN 4410 - Energy Harvesting System DesignMEEN 4810 - Topics in Mechanical and Energy EngineeringTechnical electives6 semester credit hours from the following coursesMEEN 4120 - Aerospace FundamentalsMEEN 4130 - Failure of Deformable BodiesMEEN 4140 - Finite Element AnalysisMEEN 4151 - Manufacturing of Renewable Biocomposites for Lightweight Energy Efficient StructureMEEN 4152 - Mechanics of Composites and Foams for Lightweight Energy Efficient StructuresMEEN 4160 - Mechanical VibrationsMEEN 4415 - Smart Materials and StructuresMEEN 4488 - Introduction to MicrofluidicsMEEN 4510 - Electronic Manufacturing TechnologiesMEEN 4800 - Topics in Mechanical and Energy EngineeringMEEN 4930 - Undergraduate ResearchMFET 4190 - Quality AssuranceOther required coursesMATH 1710 - Calculus IMATH 1720 - Calculus IIMATH 2700 - Linear Algebra and Vector GeometryMATH 2730 - Multivariable CalculusMATH 3410 - Differential Equations I CHEM 1415 - General Chemistry for Engineering MajorsorCHEM 1410 - General Chemistry for Science Majors  CHEM 1435 - General Chemistry Laboratory for Engineering MajorsorCHEM 1430 - Laboratory Sequence for General Chemistry  PHYS 1710 - Mechanics andPHYS 1730 - Laboratory in Mechanics PHYS 2220 - Electricity and Magnetism andPHYS 2240 - Laboratory in Wave Motion, Electricity, Magnetism and Optics TECM 2700 - Technical WritingMinorNone required.Other requirementsBS-MEEN foundation courses include TECM 2700 , MATH 1710 , PHYS 1710 /PHYS 1730 , MEEN 1000 , MEEN 2210  and MEEN 2302 . Satisfactory completion of BS-MEEN foundation courses with a minimum GPA of 2.5 is prerequisite to take advanced courses in the major.
